From the late 15th century, Europeans landed on the east coast and began colonization around 1600. At first Frenchmen and Englishmen settled down. During this time, the name \"Canada\" spread, which was originally a name for an Iroquois village. France ceded its colony of New France to Great Britain in 1763. In 1867, three British colonies founded the Canadian Confederation.

[7] 1535 gave residents of the region around the city of Quebec French explorer Jacques Cartier directions to the village Stadacona. Cartier then used the term Canada not only for this village, but for the whole area, which was dominated by the living in Stadacona chief Donnacona. From 1545 on maps and in books the name Canada was customary for this region. Cartier also named the St. Lawrence River Rivière de Canada, a name that was in use until the early 17th century. Researchers and fur traders moved west and south, increasing the area designated as \"Canada.\" In the early 18th century, the name was used for the entire modern Midwest as far as Louisiana. The British colony Québec since 1763 was divided in 1791 in Upper Canada and Lower Canada, which corresponded to about the later provinces of Ontario and Quebec. They were reunited in 1841 to become the new province of Canada.\\nIn 1867, the newly formed states of the colonies in British North America received the name \"Canada\" and the formal title Dominion. Until the 1950s, the official name Dominion of Canada was common. With increasing political autonomy vis-à-vis Britain, the government increasingly used the term Canada in legally binding documents and treaties. The Canada Act 1982 refers only to Canada, now the only official (bilingual) designation.'], 'history': ['Indians (called First Nations in Canada) colonized North America at least 12,000 years ago, marking the beginning of the Paleoindian period. About 5000 years ago, the Inuit followed. [10] The Bluefish Caves in northern Yukon have the oldest human footprints in Canada; in the Charlie Lake Cave tools were found from about 10.500 BC. From the period from about 9000 BC Finds at Banff and in Saskatchewan, but also already in Quebec. [11]', \"From about 8000 BC Chr. Followed the archaic phase. Groups from the west reached around 7500 BC. The southern Ontario. There were spear throwers. [12] Settlements were in the east of the lower St. Lawrence River and the Great Lakes and the coast of Labrador (L'Anse Amour Site) emerged at the 6th millennium, the first major tombs, later Burial Mounds.\", 'On the Great Plains emerged new weapons technologies and extensive trade, such as Chalcedony from Oregon and Obsidian from Wyoming. In some areas were still around 8000 BC. Chr. Hunted horses; they disappeared just like the megafauna. It was only later that the vast cultural space was clearly divided into two large areas, the Early Shield and the Early Plains civilization, with copper processing already being around 4800 BC. Chr.', \"In the west, the traces reach up to 8000 BC. Back, often without any recognizable cultural break. Thus Haida's culture on Haida Gwaii has existed for over 9500 years. The obsidian trade of Mount Edziza dates back more than 10,000 years. [14]\", 'Before 2500 BC There were settlements in the west and signs of social differentiation. House associations existed which seasonally hunted together in large groups. Villages can also be found in the Plains.', 'The Cree, Ojibwa, Algonkin, Innu, and Beothuk, which are graspable in the early European sources, probably go back to groups of the Shield culture. The Plains cultures were characterized by bison, dogs were used as carrying and draft animals, the tepee prevailed and the production of pemmican.', 'The most important cultural change of the plateau culture in the western interior of the country is the transition from non-acidity to half-saltiness with winter villages and summer hiking cycles around 2000 BC. A similar development occurred earlier on the coast, whose cultures can be related to the coastal Salish. Towards the end of the era plank houses can be detected for the first time. Some salish were already before 1600 BC. Peasants - as we know from the Katzie. [15] The Nuu-chah-nulth on Vancouver Island developed ocean-going canoes with which they (wholly) went for whaling.', \"The production of clay pots reached the area of \\u200b\\u200btoday's Canada probably from South America, bow and arrow came around 3000 v. Chr. From Asia and were probably first used by Paleo-Eskimos. He reached the east coast, but only about three millennia later came to the West.\", 'Dogs can be found on the Great Lakes (in Utah already around 8000 BC), who were buried. [17]\\nWith the ceramic vessels from about 500 BC On the east coast, the archaic phase, which was replaced by the Woodland periods, ended on the east coast. Some villages, mostly consisting of longhouses, were already inhabited all year round. The early Woodland period at the Great Lakes and the St. Lawrence River (about 1000 BC to 500 AD) is probably due to the Iroquois, but also to some of the Algonquian groups.', 'As far as Central Labrador, the influence of the Adena culture can be seen on the Canadian Shield. Their typical mounds also appear in the Western Shield culture, for example in southern Ontario. As a result of the domestication of wild rice, there was probably a distinct layer of landowners (Psinomani culture). Southern Ontario was involved in the far-trade relations of the Hopewell culture. Copper was distributed throughout the East of North America.', 'The late Plains culture lived heavily on bison. Remote trade was widespread and extended westwards to the Pacific. In the north smaller nomadic groups prevailed, while in the south a cycle of seasonal migrations prevailed, whose centers were fixed villages.', 'The late plateau culture fed salmon spawning, similar to the Pacific coast. From 2500 BC Chr., The so-called pit house (\"pit house\") can be detected, which was partially dug into the ground and a better stocking made possible.', 'The coastal culture was between 500 BC. and 500 AD as a ruling party from south to north stricter. A layer of leading families dominated trade and access to resources, and had political and spiritual power. Here, too, burial mounds appear for the first time. In some regions, cairns dominated, such as Victoria. The villages became more numerous and many times larger, now more fortified. The culture was characterized by plank houses, often monumental carvings (totem poles), complex ceremonies and clan structures. Nowhere was the population density as great as on the west coast.', 'In contrast, the climatic conditions and strong volcanic activity in the northwest did not allow permanent settlement.

Around 500 BC The \"Dorset Culture\" (named after Cape Dorset on a Baffin Island offshore island) followed until about 1000 AD. Around 2000 BC BC to 1000 AD was the Neo-Eskimo culture. Around 1000, a new migration from Alaska to Greenland began. The mixture of cultures was probably the Thule culture, which existed until about 1800. Their relatives are the ancestors of today\\'s Inuit.', 'European settlers reached North America at the latest around the year 1000, when Vikings lived for a short time in L\\'Anse aux Meadows at the northernmost end of Newfoundland. The \"discoverer\" of North America is Giovanni Caboto, an Italian sailor in English service. He landed on Newfoundland on June 24, 1497, presumably on the Bonavista Peninsula, and took possession of the land for England. From about 1525, Basque whalers and fishermen regularly came to the coast of Labrador and exploited the resources in the region between the Newfoundland Bank and Tadoussac for a century. [20] An expedition led by Jacques Cartier explored the area around the St. Lawrence Gulf and the St. Lawrence River in 1534/35 and declared it to be French owned.', \"Samuel de Champlain founded in 1605 with Port Royal, Nova Scotia (now Annapolis Royal) and 1608 Québec with the first permanent settlements in New France. The French colonists divided into two main groups: The Canadiens settled the valley of the St. Lawrence River, the Acadians (Acadiens) today's maritime provinces. French fur traders and Catholic missionaries explored the Great Lakes, Hudson Bay and Mississippi all the way to Louisiana. The English founded 1610 settlements on Newfoundland and colonized the thirteen colonies located further south. Cupids Plantation is the second oldest Anglo-American settlement in North America and has been more successful than Jamestown, Virginia.\", \"Between 1689 and 1763 there were four warlike conflicts in North America between Englishmen (or British) and Frenchmen, who were each part of succession wars in Europe. The King William's War (1689-1697) did not bring any territorial changes, but after the end of Queen Anne's War (1702-1713), the Treaty of Utrecht brought Britain into the possession of Acadia, Newfoundland and the Hudson Bay region. The British conquered the French fortress Louisbourg on Cape Breton Island in King George's War in 1745, but returned it in 1748 according to the Treaty of Aachen. The Seven Years War (in North America from 1754 to 1760 or 1763) finally brought the decision: With the Paris Peace, France had to cede in 1763, almost all of its possessions in North America.\", \"With the Royal Proclamation of 1763 originated from the former New France, the British province of Quebec, in the same year, the Cape Breton Island came to the colony of Nova Scotia. Also rights of the French Canadians were restricted. In 1769 another colony named St. John's Island (since 1798 Prince Edward Island) was founded. To avert conflict in Quebec, the British Parliament passed the Quebec Act in 1774. The area of \\u200b\\u200bQuébec was extended to the Great Lakes and the Ohio Valley. For the French-speaking majority of the population, French civil law applied and French was recognized as a language in public; By assuring the freedom of worship, the Roman Catholic Church was able to remain in the colony.\", 'The law, however, angered the inhabitants of the Thirteen Colonies, who saw in it an impermissible restriction on their westward expansion. The Quebec Act was one of those \"intolerable acts\" that eventually led to the United States Declaration of Independence and the American Revolutionary War. The Peace of Paris recognized American independence and the areas south of the Great Lakes fell to the United States. About 50,000 Loyalists fled to present-day Canada, along with the British allied Indian tribes, such as the Mohawk. New Brunswick was separated from Nova Scotia in 1784 in order to better organize the settlement of Loyalists on the Atlantic coast. In order to accommodate the loyalists who escaped to Quebec, the British parliament passed the constitutional law of 1791, which divided the province of Quebec into the French-speaking Lower Canada and the English-speaking Upper Canada and granted both colonies an elected parliament.', 'The tensions between the United States and Great Britain erupted in the British-American War, which lasted from 1812 to 1814 and ultimately ended inconclusively. In Canada, the war is still regarded today as a successful defense against American invasion attempts. The people of British and French developed a Canadian national feeling through the fight against a common enemy, and the loyalty of the British crown was strengthened.', 'The desire for self-government and resistance to the economic and political domination of a small elite led to the rebellions of 1837, which were quickly suppressed. Lord Durham then recommended in his investigation report the establishment of a self-governing government and the gradual assimilation of French Canadians in the British culture. The Act of Union in 1840 merged Lower and Upper Canada into the province of Canada and made English the sole official language. By 1849, the other colonies in British North America also got their own government.', \"Two trading companies, the Hudson's Bay Company (HBC) and the North West Company (NWC), controlled the trade in the vast areas of prairies and sub-arctic lands populated only by a few indigenous peoples. The HBC had received in 1670 Ruperts land as a lease area and owned there the trade monopoly with furs. But as the NWC tried to gain a foothold there were repeated armed clashes. After the Pemmican War in the Red River Colony (now Manitoba), the NWC was forced liquidated in 1821, and the HBC extended its monopoly to almost the entire northwestern continent. In 1846, the United States and Britain concluded the Oregon compromise, which set the 49th parallel as the common border west of the Great Lakes. This was followed by the founding of the Pacific Coast located colonies Vancouver Island (1849) and British Columbia (1858).\", 'During the American Civil War, leading politicians recognized the need to counter a potential US expansion effort with a strong federal state, and deliberated in three constitutional conferences on the creation of a Canadian Confederation. This resulted in the constitutional law of 1867, which came into force on July 1, 1867 and created the Dominion of Canada, which had a certain independence of the colonial power Great Britain. The province of Canada was split into Ontario and Quebec, with New Brunswick and Nova Scotia added.', \"In 1869, the new state purchased the Northwest Territory and Rupert's Land from the Hudson's Bay Company and incorporated it into the Northwest Territories. After the suppression of the Red River rebellion of the Métis created the Manitoba Act 1870 in the trouble area, the province of Manitoba. British Columbia and Vancouver Iceland (which had united in 1866) joined the Confederacy in 1871, followed two years later by Prince Edward Island.\", 'In order to open up the west to immigrant settlement, the government helped finance transcontinental railroads and established the North-West Mounted Police (now Royal Canadian Mounted Police) to enforce state control over the prairies and sub-arctic regions. The Northwest Rebellion and the subsequent execution of the Métis leader Louis Riel in 1885 led to a deep rift between the two language groups. As a direct result of the Klondike gold rush, the Yukon Territory was created in 1898. Due to the increasing settlement of the prairie created in 1905 from the southern part of the Northwest Territories, the provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan. Between 1871 and 1921, Canada signed eleven treaties with the Indians, granting them reserves for small compensations, but guaranteeing them their usual way of life. Until the 1960s, they tried to forcibly assimilate them and forbade the students to use their native languages. The indigenous peoples were not allowed to participate in national parliamentary elections until 1960.', 'On the British side, Canada participated in the First World War from 1914 and sent volunteers to the Western Front. When the government tried to introduce compulsory military service against the resistance of the French-speaking part of the population, the conscription crisis of 1917 occurred.', 'In the negotiation of the Treaty of Versailles, Canada emerged as an independent state and joined the League of Nations in 1919, independent of Great Britain. The Statute of Westminster of 1931 guaranteed legislative independence, but certain constitutional ties remained. The country was hit particularly hard by the global economic crisis, as a reaction developed in the following decades, a well-developed welfare state.', \"Canada declared war on the German Reich in 1939. Despite another conscription crisis, Canadian troops played an important role during the Second World War, especially in the Atlantic Battle, Operation Jubilee, the invasion of Italy, Operation Overlord (landing on Juno Beach) and the Battle of the Scheldt Estuary. Mackenzie King's government did not dare send soldiers against their will to a war effort overseas. So men remained in the scope of five divisions in Canada, where they did nothing other than to guard German prisoners of war. Among the Canadian volunteers who fought Europe against Germany, this caused great discontent. [23] In 1945, Canadian soldiers were used extensively during the battles for the Netherlands.\", 'The British Newfoundland colony, which had not joined the state in 1867 and had been an independent Dominion from 1907 to 1934, became the last province of the Canadian Confederation in 1949 after a long-lasting political and economic crisis. In 1965, the new maple leaf flag was introduced and with the entry into force of the official language law, Canada was officially a bilingual country from 1969 onwards. Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau sought full formal independence from Britain, which became a reality with the 1982 Constitution and the Charter of Rights and Freedoms.', 'During the 1960s, Québec saw a profound social and economic revolution known as the \"Silent Revolution\".

Moderate nationalists from 1976 the provincial government, 1980, a first independence referendum was rejected with 59.6% of the votes. Another sign of this upheaval is the replacement of the Francophone population by the Catholic Church.', 'The Constitution Act / Loi constitutionelle of 17 April 1982, with which also constitutional amendments no longer have to be approved by the British Parliament, is considered the date of formal independence (full sovereignty) of Canada.\\nThe Federal Government\\'s efforts to recognize Québec as a \"distinctive society\" with the Meech Lake Accord failed in 1989.

They have developed their own language, the Michif. Numerous other Canadians have Indian ancestors. Their marriages were very often made according to the \"custom of the country\", ie without church or government involvement - as was common in marriages between men of the Hudson\\'s Bay Company and Indian women. Marriages of this kind were only valid from 1867 on.', 'In the 2006 census, 1,172,790 Canadians said they were members of an indigenous group.

They refer to the treaties that have been concluded with Canada and the UK, such as the Numbered Treaties, to general human rights and to decisions of the upper courts in the UK and Canada.

In the Federal Courts, in Parliament and in all federal institutions, English and French are equal. Citizens have the right to use federal services in English or French. In all the provinces and territories, linguistic minorities are guaranteed school education in their own schools, a privilege that has long been disputed.

Ontario has the largest French-speaking population outside Quebec. The Charter of the French Language declares French to be the sole official language in Quebec, and New Brunswick is the only province whose constitution guarantees bilingualism. [46] Other provinces have no official language defined as such; however, French is used in addition to English in schools, courts and government services. Manitoba, Ontario and Quebec allow for equality of speaking English and French in provincial parliaments, and laws are enacted in both languages. In Ontario, individual communities know French as a second official language. The election of the capital of the former British North America by Queen Victoria (1857) may have been due to Ottawa, because it was approximately on the border between Franco and Anglophone area.\", 'All regions have non-English or French-speaking minorities, mostly descendants of the indigenous people.

Several schools teach the language, as well as three colleges and founded in 2006 Atlantic Gaelic Academy. It was not until 1973 that German schools were again supported by the state in Ontario. Between 1977 and 1990, schools received funds from the government's multiculturalism program.\", 'With the colonization came first of all French Catholics and Anglican English to Canada. In addition, Britain promoted the immigration of Protestant groups from the Middle Rhine and Württemberg, to a lesser extent from Switzerland, France and the Netherlands, so that the south of Nova Scotia is still Protestant.', \"However, in 1774, with the Quebec Act, the colonial power gave up any attempt to persuade Catholics to convert. After the independence of the United States, many Protestant loyalists came to today's Ontario and formed the majority there. In later immigration waves came again Catholic Irish and Italians, but also Ukrainian Duchoborzen added. The immigration from Scotland, in turn, brought about the elimination of the primacy of the Anglican Church in the East by numerous Presbyterians. In Toronto, the Methodists prevailed.\", \"In opposition to the Catholics who were more inclined to ultramontanism (les bleus), but also to the dominant Anglicans, who were supported by the Orange Order, formed anticlerical groups (especially les rouges). With the Lord's Day Act of 1906 a widespread work ban was enforced on Sunday, which claimed validity until the 1960s and the supreme court until 1985 finally abolished. A similar reduction in the importance of everyday religious life took place in Quebec. However, there are significant groups, particularly in southern Manitoba and Ontario, in Alberta and inland British Columbia. These include the Mennonites in southern Manitoba, the Ukrainian Orthodox and Catholics in Manitoba and Saskatchewan, the Mormons are a focal point in Alberta. In addition, there are the Jehovah's Witnesses and many other groups.

They are concentrated in big cities, especially in Greater Toronto. The oldest synagogue, Congregation Emanu-El, was built in 1863 in Victoria, the first mosque in 1938 with the Al Rashid Mosque in Edmonton.', 'About 67.3% of the Canadian population belonged to a Christian denomination in 2011 (39.0% Catholic, about 24.1% Protestant). The two largest Protestant denominations are the United Church of Canada at 6.1% and the Anglican Church of Canada at 6.9%, plus 1.9% Baptists, 1.4% Lutherans, about 1.7% Orthodox and about 3.0% other Christian denominations. Muslims represent about 3.2% of the population, more than half of them living in Ontario. About 1.0% are Jews, of whom nearly 60% live in Ontario, and about 1.1% Buddhists, 1.5% Hindus and 1.4% Sikhs. About 23.9% said they did not belong to any denomination.

According to a 2007 survey, Muslims in Canada felt significantly more integrated than in European countries. [57] Overall, as part of its integration policy, Canadian policy focuses more on preserving and using ethnic and religious particularities than on adaptation. [58]', 'Canada has one of the highest immigration rates in the world in terms of population, as measured by population. [59] Immigration is driven by defined objectives set in a program. [60] The immigration criteria are publicly available and can be checked even before the application is submitted. For example, for people with jobs that are in demand in Canada, the Skilled Worker program exists. Depending on the situation of the labor market, a minimum number of points (in January 2010: 67 points) will be set that an immigrant must reach. The personal score is made up of current education and work experience points, language proficiency points in English and French, and age, relatives, and previous stays in Canada. A binding offer of employment from a Canadian employer significantly increases the score again. The Immigration Program was amended on July 1, 2011, to allow only those who have experience in one of 29 defined occupations to qualify for the Skilled Worker Program without an existing job offer. [61] In addition, a prospective customer must prove to the Skilled Worker program that he can provide himself financially for a certain time. The necessary sum for a single person is currently (September 2011) at 11,115 CAD, for a four-member family at 20,654 CAD. [62] In addition, police certificates are required from all countries where the candidate has lived for six months or more after their 18th birthday.', 'The immigration takes place in two stages. First, a permanent residence and work permit is issued. After three years as a permanent resident and residence in the country, the application for naturalization can be made. Immigrants who have not yet naturalized, have Residenzpflicht. This means that you have to provide evidence for the given time in Canada, or be married to someone who has Canadian citizenship. In case of violations, the permanent resident status can be withdrawn and the immigrant returned to his country of origin.', 'In addition to the program for qualified immigrants, there is a separate regulation for immigrant workers who have no prospect of naturalization. [63] The number of temporary workers admitted to Canada has exceeded that of immigrants since about 2006. The guest workers receive work permits, which are usually valid for a few months and rarely exceed the duration of one year. They apply only to the employer who brings the workers into the country, a termination is associated with the loss of the residence permit. While the Gastro Workers Program was originally introduced to nurses in households, nannies and agricultural workers, it is now used for all low-paid jobs.', 'In 2015, 186,000 Germans born in Germany lived in Canada.', 'Most common countries of origin of migrants by country of birth in 2015 [64]'], 'Constitution and law': ['Canada is formally a constitutional monarchy within the Commonwealth of Nations with Queen Elizabeth II as head of state. She bears the title of \"Queen of Canada\" and is represented by the Governor-General. [65] [66] The country is also a representative parliamentary democracy organized in the form of a federal state. The constitution of Canada consists of written sources of law and unwritten customary law. [67] The constitutional law of 1867 contains the state organization law, established a parliamentary system of government based on the Westminster system of the United Kingdom, and divided power between the federal and provincial governments. The Statute of Westminster of 1931 granted full legislative autonomy, and the 1982 Constitutional Act resolved the final constitutional ties with the British motherland. The latter includes a catalog of fundamental rights (the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms) and provisions on how to proceed with constitutional amendments. [67] Along with status as a monarchy, there are a number of titles and medals awarded in Canada.', 'In the 2016 Democracy Index, Canada ranks 6th out of 167 countries, ranking among the \"full democracies\". Canada is thus one of the freest societies in the world. [68]', 'Theoretically, executive power rests with the monarch but is exercised in practice by the Cabinet (formally a committee of the Canadian Privy Council) and by the representative of the monarch, the Governor-General. The monarch and his representatives are apolitical and exercise predominantly ceremonial functions to guarantee the stability of the government. According to customary law, they hand over all political affairs to their ministers in the Cabinet, who in turn are responsible to the elected lower house. The executive power is thus de facto in the Cabinet, but monarch and governor-general can exercise their sovereignty in the event of an extraordinary constitutional crisis.', 'The Prime Minister is usually the chairman of the party that holds the most seats in the lower house and has the confidence of the majority of deputies. He is appointed by the Governor-General and leads the Cabinet as head of government. Since he has extensive powers, he is considered the most powerful person in the state. He appoints the other Cabinet members, Senators, Supreme Court judges, heads of state enterprises and authorities, and can propose the vice-governors of the provinces. Among other things, the Federal Government is responsible for foreign affairs, defense, trade, finance, traffic and postal services, as well as overseeing the administration of the three federal territories. Julie Payette has been Governor-General of Canada since October 2, 2017. [69] The Liberal Party leader, Justin Trudeau, has been Prime Minister since 4 November 2015, heading the 29th Canadian Cabinet.', 'The Canadian federal parliament consists of the monarch and two chambers, the democratically elected House of Commons (Chambre des communes) and the appointed Senate of Canada (Senate of Canada, Sénat de Canada).', 'Each member of the lower house is elected in relative majority voting in one of 338 constituencies. Women\\'s suffrage was introduced in 1918. [70] General elections are held by the Governor General if the prime minister so proposes it or if the government loses a vote of no confidence. According to a law passed in 2006, the term of office is four years. Previously, the Prime Minister could set the election date at will, but a new election had to take place at the latest after five years. The government currently represents the Liberal Party, while the Conservative Party has the role of \"official opposition.\" Other parties represented in Parliament are referred to as \"third parties\". These are the New Democratic Party, the Bloc Québécois and the Green Party.', 'In the Senate of Canada, also called \"upper house\" (English upper house, French chambre haute), sitting 105 MPs, appointed by the Governor General on the recommendation of the Prime Minister. The seats are divided into regions, which have not been adjusted since 1867 and therefore there are large disproportionalities in the representation in relation to the population. The senators have no fixed term, but can hold their office until the age of 75 years. The influence of the Senate is significantly less than that of the lower house.', \"Canada's legal system plays an important role in the interpretation of laws. It takes into account the changing social conditions and has the power to revoke laws that violate the Constitution. The Supreme Court is the highest court and last resort. The nine members are appointed by the Governor-General on the proposal of the Prime Minister and the Minister of Justice. Chief Justice of Canada has been Beverley McLachlin since 2000. The federal government appoints also judges of the supreme courts of the provinces and territories. The appointment of judges at lower levels falls within the jurisdiction of provincial and territorial governments.\", \"In the provinces, the highest courts are the Courts of Appeal. Their judgments, unlike those of the Supreme Court in Ottawa, are not binding in the other provinces, though they are not without influence. Occasionally, the London Court of Appeal and the British House of Lords are still considered as another legal source. Their pre-1867 decisions are still binding, unless the Canadian Supreme Court overturned them. The same applies to decisions until 1949 for the Privy Council's judicial committee. This is of considerable importance for the status of the indigenous and francophone populations, as older contracts with the British Crown remain valid.\", 'Canada is a federal state divided into ten provinces and three territories. These subnational units can be divided into geographic regions. Western Canada consists of British Columbia and the three prairie provinces of Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba. Central Canada includes the two most populous provinces of Ontario and Quebec. Maritime provinces are New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island and Nova Scotia; together with Newfoundland and Labrador they form the Atlantic provinces. The three territories Yukon, Northwest Territories and Nunavut cover all areas north of the 60th parallel and west of Hudson Bay.', 'The provinces have a high degree of autonomy, whereas in the territories the federal government undertakes numerous administrative tasks itself. All provinces and territories have a unicameral parliament and a prime minister as head of government. The Canadian monarch is represented in all provinces by a vice-governor, [71] who is equal to the governor-general and performs predominantly ceremonial duties. In the territories, a commissioner appointed by the federal government assumes the duties of a vice-governor.', 'While in most federal constitutions of federal states alone the legislative powers of the federation are explicitly enumerated, the constitutional law of 1867 (English Constitution Act, 1867, French Loi constitutionnelle de 1867) leads not only in article 91 the exclusive powers of the federation, but in Articles 92, 92A and 93 also include the exclusive competences of the provinces. After that, the provinces have the right to legislate u. a. in the fields of direct taxes, civil servants, public institutions, community affairs, education, hospitality and other local businesses, property and civil law, judicature, civil procedure, mining, forestry and energy.', 'In 1974, efforts were made in the Canadian parliament to include the British overseas territory of the Turks and Caicos Islands in the Caribbean as the eleventh province in the Canadian state association. The bill, however, found no majority and was thus rejected. Since 2003, however, there are renewed efforts in this direction. Firstly, Britain would have to release the islands into independence and, secondly, would have to agree to every single Canadian province. The latter, however, is unlikely because of the very complicated Canadian constitutional procedures.', 'Although Canada is a relatively young country, the legal system has a long tradition. The Common Law, which applies in all provinces except Québec, is based on principles that have developed in England for centuries and are a legacy of the British colonial era. The civil code in Québec in the field of private law reflects principles of the French legal system. By contrast, criminal law is a matter for the state and uniform in all provinces. Over time, both legal systems have been adapted to the requirements in Canada. Law enforcement is the responsibility of the provinces, but it is transferred to the federal Royal Canadian Mounted Police in rural areas (except Quebec and Ontario). Both legal systems have been incorporated into the constitution. Its core originated in 1867 with the founding of Canada and was last augmented in 1982 fundamentally by the Constitutional Law of 1982 and the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.', 'Canada abolished the death penalty for peacetime crimes in 1976, and in 1998 martial law. Trigger was the 1959 condemnation of the then 14-year-old Steven Truscott to death. He was paroled after ten years in prison and acquitted in 2007.

Cooperation in the military and economic fields is narrow; Both countries are each other's largest trading partner under the North American Free Trade Agreement.\", 'Nevertheless, Canada has an independent foreign policy. It maintains diplomatic relations with Cuba and did not participate in the Vietnam or the Iraq war. The country traditionally maintains close relations with the United Kingdom and France, membership of the Commonwealth of Nations and the international organization of the Francophonie, as well as other former British and French colonies. Another focus of foreign relations relations are the states of the Caribbean Community. In the International Policy Statement published in 2005, the government established foreign policy guidelines. Canada sees the European Union as a strategic partner in the areas of climate change, energy supply, trade and environmental protection as well as foreign and security policy issues.', 'An important part of Canadian identity is the support of multilateralism. [76] In 1945, Canada was one of the founding members of the United Nations. The later Prime Minister Lester Pearson contributed significantly to the settlement of the Suez Crisis and was awarded in 1957 for the Nobel Peace Prize. Until then, if one spoke of the \"birth of the Canadian nation on the battlefields of Europe,\" [77] a peacekeeping myth evolved, which saw Canada\\'s role as distinct from the USA, under the impression of numerous UN peacekeeping missions.', '\"Canadians were middlemen, honest brokers, useful helpers in a world where these qualities were rare. Peacekeeping changed us, made us better in a way. \"', 'Canada is a member of many international organizations such as the OSCE, the World Trade Organization, the OECD, the OAS, the APEC and the Group of Seven (G7).', 'Various international agreements were made on Canadian initiative and were adopted in that country. These include the Ottawa Convention on the Prohibition of Anti-Personnel Mines and the Montreal Protocol for the Protection of the Ozone Layer.', 'In connection with the irritations of the new US President Donald Trump, Justin Trudeau expressed in Belleville with basic statements on the relationship between the two countries: [79]', '\"At the same time, Canada is a separate country from the US, and there are things that are expensive to us that Americans do not put first. I never shy away from advocating points that I believe in - whether it\\'s an explanation, that I am a feminist, whether it is that immigration is a source of our strength and that Muslim Canadians are an essential part of it have the success of our country, today and in the future. \"'], 'military': ['The Canadian Forces (French Forces Canadiennes) emerged in their present form in 1968, when the Army, Navy and Air Force were merged organizationally. The troops in 2011 included around 68,250 volunteer volunteers and 26,873 reservists. [80] In addition came (as of 2012) 5,000 Canadian Rangers whose main task is to show military presence in remote Arctic regions. [81] The armed forces have about 1400 armored vehicles, 34 warships and 300 fighter jets. Canada spent almost 1.3 percent of its economic output or $ 20.6 billion on its military forces in 2017, putting it in 14th place worldwide. [82]', 'Due to the close ties to the British motherland, Canadian troops were involved in the Boer War, the First World War and the Second World War. Since 1948, Canada has been a significant part of the United Nations peacekeeping force and has been involved in more peacekeeping missions than any other nation (since 1989 without exception). [83] The country basically only participates in acts of war sanctioned by the United Nations, such as the war in Korea, the Persian Gulf, Afghanistan, but without a UN mandate in Kosovo. Canada is a founding member of NATO and a contractor to the North American Airspace Defense Alliance NORAD.'], 'education': ['There is no unified national education system in federalist Canada, but tertiary education is subject to a consistent state quality control system, and most Canadian universities are members of the Association of Universities and Colleges of Canada (AUCC), which is why the standard is generally considered balanced. [84]', 'The education system is governed exclusively by the provinces and territories; there is no national education ministry. Therefore, in some provinces, school entry age (fifth or sixth year of age) and duration of elementary school (up to grade 6 or 7) differ. Secondary education (known as Québec École polyvalente) consists of a comprehensive school, three-year junior high school (lower secondary education) and two- to four-year senior high school (upper secondary education). Since the education system seeks equal opportunities, the transition from one school level to another takes place without a performance test. Only within the senior high school is the acquisition of the diploma (Diploma of Secondary Diploma) dependent on whether a certain number of credit points is reached. Two percent of the schools are private, mostly clerical hands. About ten percent of students attend a private school. [85] The performance levels of private schools were very high in 2006, and Canada was the only OECD country where their students learned more, even after balancing the family and socio-economic background, than students in public schools. [86]', \"While the school attendance is free of charge, tuition fees of different amounts are due at the universities. [87] Of the more than 80 universities, the University of Toronto and the University of Montreal are among the largest. The oldest are the University of Laval in Québec from 1663, a Jesuit institution named after Bishop Laval. This touches on a feature of Canadian higher education development because the early institutions were almost all of ecclesiastical origin. It was only in 1818 that the first secular college and second Canadian, Dalhousie University in Halifax, was established. This was followed by the two English-speaking institutes, McGill University in Montreal (1821) and the University of Toronto (1827). They were followed in the 1840s, the Queen's University in Kingston (1841) and the University of Ottawa (1848). The latter, like the Laval University, goes back to a missionary order, in this case the Oblates of the Immaculate Virgin Mary. After independence in 1867, the University of Western Ontario, founded by an Anglican bishop in London (1878) and the University of Montreal (the second of four colleges in the city) founded that same year, and McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario. The latter was originally founded in Toronto and moved to Hamilton until 1930. She goes back to the Baptist Convention of Ontario.\", 'Colleges usually lend only 3- to 4-year bachelor degrees (eg minor, majors, specialization, honors), universities also 1-year consecutive \"post-bachelor\" bachelor with honors / baccalaureatus cum honore, 1- up to 3-year Master\\'s and 3 to 5-year Ph.D. degrees. For example, in the long-term average ranking of North America\\'s most widely ranked, the QS World University Rankings, McGill University ranked # 1 in Canada in 2018 and No. 28 in the world, according to the Academic Ranking of World Universities (Shanghai Ranking) from 2018 (Jiaotong University of Shanghai) ranked the University of Toronto at # 23 and the University of British Columbia ranked # 43 in Vancouver among the best colleges. The First Nations have had their own university since 2003, the First Nations University of Canada in Regina, capital of the province of Saskatchewan. In 1989, the major universities began to team up to coordinate research projects. Since 2011, the group has existed as the U15 Group of Canadian Research Universities, which now includes a closed circle of 15 universities. In 2016, over half a million foreign students studied at Canadian educational institutions. The largest group came from the People\\'s Republic of China. [88]', \"In the 2015 PISA ranking, Canada's students ranked 10th out of 72 countries in mathematics, 7th in science, and second in reading comprehension. Canadian students were among the best in all participating countries and performed significantly better than those from the neighboring United States. The study also found that students from Ontario and British Columbia performed the best.

Canada's nature has become the most important factor for tourism. This is supported by 43 national and more than 1500 provincial parks and other protected areas, which mainly contain huge forest areas. The oldest of them is the Banff National Park of 1885, which is now accessed via freeways-like roads mass tourism. Parks Canada / Parcs Canada was founded in 1911 as the oldest national park administration in the world. But tourist, conservation, recreational and scientific interests collide with the exploitation interests of the extractive industry and occasionally the interests of the indigenous people.\", 'Intact primeval forests (old growth) exist in Canada even after three centuries of depletion due to the low density of population still on enormously large areas. According to Global Forest Watch Canada, 62% of the boreal forests and 30% of the temperate forests are still intact (natural ecosystems that are essentially unaffected by humans). [29] However, the exploitation on the border with the populated areas is immense and has left there only small jungle remains. Without the resistance of environmental organizations such as Greenpeace, which was founded in Vancouver, or the Western Canada Wilderness Committee and the local Indians, these primeval forests would certainly no longer exist. The companies in the timber industry are so closely connected with the political elites of the provinces that only international pressure and often coercion of the federal government and the courts could save the stocks in some cases (see Clayoquot Sound). By contrast, scientists and numerous environmental organizations have joined forces, and the long-neglected Green Party of Canada [90] won nearly seven percent of voters in the 2008 election.

In addition, it takes 29th place in water consumption. Overall, Canada, Belgium, and the US are at the bottom of the group. [92] In October 2008, several hundred scientists tried to resist the discrediting of their work by the government. At the same time, the biggest protests in the last 15 years against the deforestation of the last primeval forests on Vancouver Island took place in Victoria.

On October 14, 2008, the Cree, who are aware of the legally privileged role of the provinces vis-à-vis the federal government in matters of mineral resources and power generation and against Indian nations, therefore rejected the Quebec provincial government\\'s \"Green Plan.\" [96] He would also have returned to Québec the administration of the vast James Bay area, which had won the Cree after long negotiations in 2002. Since 2009, three local Cree groups with international support have been fighting for the forest in the Broadback Valley, a large contiguous boreal jungle bordering the logging area.', \"In northeastern British Columbia alone, seven police-reported attacks on Encana Corporation's gas pipelines from 2005 to 2008 were reported to be extremely dangerous, transporting highly toxic hydrogen sulfide.

The country's gross domestic product per capita stood at $ 42,210 in 2016 18th place, and adjusted for purchasing power at 46,437 US dollars in place 25. In the Human Development Index 2016 of the United Nations Development Program, which also takes into account non-economic factors, Canada ranks tenth. [100] The country is also considered a social market economy. In the Global Competitiveness Index, which measures the competitiveness of a country, Canada ranks 14th out of 137 countries (as of 2017-18). [101] In the index of economic freedom, the country ranks seventh in 180 countries in 2017.

Employees of the State of Canada receive at least the minimum wage applicable in the province in which they are employed. In 2017, it was between 10.72 (Saskatchewan) and $ 13.00 (Nunavut). [104] This minimum wage may be deviated from in some states for different employment groups (eg for employees who receive tips or for young people). Also, some states have introduced annual automatic adjustments (eg adjustment to inflation rates).', \"The proportion of primary production, ie the primary economic sector, is above average due to the abundance of natural resources. The amount of nickel mined in the province of Ontario covers about 20% of world demand, Canada has the largest oil reserves in Saudi Arabia at about 24 billion tons, has ten percent of the world's forests, and significant deposits of sulfur, asbestos, aluminum, and gold , Lead, coal, copper, iron ore, potassium carbonate, tantalum, uranium and zinc. [105] Extensive deposits of natural gas are located off the coast of the Atlantic provinces and the Athabasca oil sands in Alberta. [106] Forest and water power form the basis for the pulp and paper industry.\", \"Numerous reservoirs supply electricity and thus form the backbone of energy production. 360,000 GWh alone came from hydropower, making Canada the second most important producer of electricity in this sector, just behind China. [107] Canada covers more than eleven percent of the world's electricity needs, and it is one of the few industrialized countries that are net exporters of energy. [108] The connection within North America is now so close that huge, cross-border supply networks have developed, such as the Western Interconnection, which extends to Mexico. Other energy suppliers are gas, oil, uranium (18 producing nuclear power plants) and renewable energies. Nuclear power plants supplied exactly 85,219,889 of a total of 565,519,793 GWh of electricity in 2010, or about 15% of the electricity.

[111] Added to this is livestock farming, especially cattle breeding, and in recent years the commercial breeding of bison. Fish farming is practiced on the coasts, but this conflicts with the catching of wild fish. British Columbia is the largest exporter of salmon and halibut.', \"The industrial centers are located in the south of the provinces of Ontario and Quebec, especially in the metropolitan areas of Toronto and Montreal. The automotive and aviation industries play an important role in this, along with the metal industry, food processing and the wood and paper industry. The chemical and electrotechnical industries, but above all the high-tech sector, also play an important role. This is related to the decline of the major automotive companies in the US, which mainly hits the suppliers and dépouses in the conurbation of Toronto. By contrast, all of the industries that invest in the gas and oil exploration sector are concentrated in the Calgary metropolitan area, but this prosperous industry has recently suffered from rapid price erosion and rising exploration costs. This is partly due to geological constraints, with the now very high wage levels and the growing resistance to the destruction of the environment. Nevertheless, Canada became the world's fourth biggest producer of crude oil in 2018. [112]\", \"Exports amounted to 36.7% in 2007 and imports to 32.8% of GDP.

While the economy in the first half of the 20th century was still largely export-oriented, especially to the British Empire, trade barriers to its neighbor USA after the Second World War were gradually reduced to a large extent. A first important step was the 1965 agreed Canada-United States Automotive Agreement (also called Auto Pact), which completely opened the boundaries for the automotive industry. The 1988 Canadian-American Free Trade Agreement abolished tariffs between the two countries and resulted in a significant increase in trade and US investment in Canada. With the North American Free Trade Agreement, this free trade area was extended to Mexico in 1994. Other free trade agreements exist, inter alia, with EFTA.

[117] Therefore, in 2007, the government launched a program called Mobilizing Science and Technology to Canada's Advantage. It aims to increase the low number of patents and encourage more research and development investment. It should also promote cooperation between state educational institutions and industrial complexes. In addition, Centers of Excellence in Commercialization and Research and a College and Community Innovation Program have been established.\", 'The largest employee representation is the Canadian Labor Congress (CLC) or French, the Congrès du Travail du Canada (CTC) with its approximately one hundred individual unions in 136 districts, which claims to have three million members.

While the TLC was similar to Europe, organized by industry, the CCL was organized by location and included all trades. In addition, the TLC had supported the Liberals, while the CCL supporters of the Socialist Co-operative Commonwealth Federation were represented. At the same time, it integrated the Communist Workers Unity League (WUL) in 1939 when it formed an alliance against fascism. The British Columbia-based International Woodworkers of America were also considered communist, but were integrated in 1948. A little later, the communists were expelled.

In 1785, Fleury Mesplet, whom the British had detained for his request to join the United States, created what is today the oldest leaf, the Montreal Gazette. In 1793, the first newspaper in Ontario, the Upper Canada Gazette, followed in Niagara-on-the-Lake. These early papers largely depended on government grants and advertising revenues, barely of buyers and subscribers. This should prove to be permanent in Canada.\", 'In Quebec emerged in 1805 and 1811 the City Mercury and in Montreal the Herald as mouthpieces of the local merchant elite, while Le Canadien (1806) and La Minerve (1826) represented the Francophones. Against these colonial and merchant elites, Colonial Advocate, which William Lyon Mackenzie brought out, represented the reform and farmer groups in Upper Canada. The same was true of Joseph Howes Novascotian (1824) in Halifax.', \"Most newspapers depended on parties, especially reformers (today's liberals) and conservatives, mostly as organs of certain political leaders. The Toronto Globe (1844) was the voice of the reformer George Brown, while the Toronto Mail (1872) soon became the voice of John Macdonald, Canada's first premier. Similarly, 1899 businessmen reorganized the Toronto Star in favor of Wilfrid Laurier. In turn, the local conservatives bought the Toronto News 1908 as a party organ. Each major city therefore had a liberal and a conservative body, which provided the respective clientele. Until the 1930s, the Quebec leaves remained dependent on the respective government.\", \"Leaves that did not belong to any of the leading groups, such as the communist press, were repeatedly banned.

The survivors of the Titanic owed their rescue to the radio waves sent by Marconi. He was also the first to receive a private broadcasting license in Canada in 1919. In 1928 there were already 60 radio stations.', 'Nevertheless, a commission led by John Aird found many Canadians listening to US stations this year. It was not until 1932 that the British Judicial Committee of the Privy Council decided that the state rightly claimed supervision over radio communications. In 1936, the public Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) began broadcasting, which had been started by the Radio Commission since 1932. By then, the number of radio receivers had doubled to one million within five years.', \"Today's structure of the CBC is a product of the global economic crisis: only five central stations were created whose broadcasts were forwarded by private distributors. This created a mixed system of state and private broadcasters, in which private broadcasters were only allowed a regional broadcast. Canada became one of the countries with the most radio stations, and one of the first with satellite stations. Nevertheless, the US competition is strongly represented.\", 'Television has been broadcast in Canada since 1952, with the CBC playing the regulatory role and becoming the most important channel. Again, private networks served as distributors for CBC-TV. A campaign of private broadcasters against the CBC monopoly followed the Broadcasting Act of 1958 under John Diefenbaker. A 15-member Board of Broadcast Governors (BBG) was created, which accepted applications for new channels and promoted more private stations. The TV expanded rapidly and in 1961 a second network, CTV, was created. Violent disputes arose between the BBG and the CBC, and in 1968 the licensing was given to the Canadian Radio-Television Commission (now the Canadian Radio-Television and Telecommunications Commission, CRTC), which also acquired the cable television established in 1968. The claim to \"protection, enrichment and strengthening of the cultural, political, social and economic structure of Canada\", as it is called in the law, should be respected. Nevertheless, austerity over the last four decades has led to increasing reliance on advertising budgets and ratings.', 'In this case, US broadcasters can be received virtually anywhere via cable. As a result, they occupy about 75% of prime time broadcasting in English-speaking Canada, compared to only 40% in Québec.

Many of their traditions continue to be part of Canada, such as their food, language, stories, history, holidays and sports. The cultural festivals of these immigrants are an integral part of Canadian life, such as the Chinese New Year in Vancouver or the Caribana procession in Toronto. Many Canadians can still trace their roots back to these lands and are proud of their heritage.

At the same time, large cultural areas can be distinguished. On the Pacific coast, the culture was dominated by fishing, especially salmon, or whaling, as in the Nuu-chah-nulth on Vancouver Island. There you will also find the massive totem poles, the largest of which is over 50 m high. Inland, hunting, gathering and river fishing dominated.

Early known were the masks and totem poles of the Pacific Coast, which still play an important role in the self-image, but also on the art market. Similar to literature, the Indian art scene does not only pursue traditional elements, but also connects them with Euro-Canadian means. Other Indian artists produce detached from these traditions in their genres and their means. Nevertheless, artists with a specific Indian way, such as Norval Morrisseau, or the sculptor and carver Bill Reid, who continued the work of Charles Edenshaw, have only been recognized since the 1960s.

[137] The parallel development of European music has never been broken off from baroque to classical and romantic to contemporary music. However, the New World has long lacked the resources needed to perform large-scale performances, such as operas, to any significant extent. It was not only the adaptation of texts, but also the exchange of elements between the immigrant groups that produced Canadian peculiarities, to which came influences from the USA.', 'John Braham was one of the first singers to become known throughout the country (from 1841), similar to Jenny Lind. In addition, there were numerous church choirs and philharmonic societies. The first societies of this kind were the New Union Singing Society of Halifax (1809) and the Québec Harmonic Society (1820). Ballads, dance music and patriotic hymns were popular. Germans first brought the piano to Canada (Thomas Heintzman), followed by the organ (Joseph Casavant). In 1903, C. A. E. Harriss organized the Cycle of Musical Festivals of the Dominion of Canada, which involved more than 4,000 singers and musicians across 15 cities nationwide. With the First World War and the then growing record industry, the pinnacle of homemade music, but also the opera companies was exceeded. Nevertheless, before and after the Great Depression, symphony orchestras emerged, especially in the three largest cities of Montreal, Toronto and Vancouver. Sir Ernest MacMillan was the first and only Canadian musician to be knighted, and more singers sang on the main stages.', 'Only field researchers such as Marius Barbeau, W.

Nevertheless, in the 1930s, musician associations emerged, which strengthened the search for Canadian identity in music after the war. Also, this music was promoted by the state, collections of traditional and Indian music inspired the more open-minded generation. Publications such as The Canadian Music Journal (1956-1962), Opera Canada (since 1960) and The Canada Music Book (1970-1976) underpinned this development.

The same goals are served by the Genie Award, which is awarded every year for the best Canadian films.', 'Canada is also known as Hollywood of the North. The most important production sites for Canadian and American films today are Vancouver, followed by Montreal and Toronto.

[143] Therefore, the country often appears as dismissive in view of its nature, as a cultural desert that is revived from the outside, and as a raw material for career and investment. The expectations and stereotypes of the audience about the wilderness, unimaginable breadth and the introduction of civilization, especially by Europeans, also played an important role. However, the urge to capture the richness of one's own culture that has developed, without cutting its roots, prevails in the meantime.\", 'During the 19th century, indigenous (igloo) and local word (moose) came into the literature, but also French (gopher) into the English and vice versa. Nevertheless, the English language is understood throughout the country and dominated by overarching language standards. In French literature, as a further element, a strong connection to France and its lifestyle is added, which explains a skepticism about the British as understood rest of Canada partially.', \"A salient feature of Canadian literature is the humor, which is, however, rather subterranean, sometimes black, and often used as an understatement. Regional traditions of storytelling and anecdotal play an important role, less the choice of subject matter - unless it is local peculiarities or differences between ethnic groups. Common motifs include garrison mentality, the alienation from home to which one returns, strangeness in one's own country or specific culture, but also the celebration of the wilderness that provides spiritual recovery.\", 'Canadians are particularly keen on the history of their ancestors, and so there are a large number of biographical attempts to historically significant men and women. But even there clichés are almost inevitable. Catholic Québec, for example, is considered mysterious, Ontario torn between moral clarity and lavaring, the prairies as isolating and possessive, the West Coast the projection of hopes and expectations that one must unmask. The country life is disproportionately in the foreground, while the cities were almost ignored for a long time. By contrast, authors such as Frances Brooke (1724-1789), Susanna Moodie (1803-1885), Sara Jeannette Duncan (1861-1922), and Nellie McClung (1873-1951) were the analysts of political life clenching in the cities.', 'There is a contrast between the perception of Europe and that of the neighbor USA. Europe is regarded as a haven of refinement, but also of extreme regionalization, the neighbor as a country of social hardship and a fixation on economic success.', 'Historically, it was mainly French, English and Irish styles that were in vogue in their home countries. But even in the travelogues developed a Canadian influenced genre, as in Samuel Hearne (1745-1792), Alexander MacKenzie, David Thompson, Catharine Parr Traill (1802-1899) or Anna Jameson (1794-1860), the spectrum of romanticizing Adventure Report (John R. Jewitt, 1783-1821) to precise analysis (Susanna Moodie: Roughing It in The Bush, or Forest Life in Canada, 1852). The Confederation (1867) raised the question of national culture. By the end of the 19th century, four figures dominated the literary scene: Duncan Campbell Scott (1862-1947), Charles GD Roberts (1860-1943), Archibald Lampman (1861-1899) and Bliss Carman (1861-1929), who Confederation Group \"or\" Confederation Poets \".', \"The First World War brought the outside world back into focus, and at the same time, immigration drew attention to the many cultures, including those of the Indians, who now began to express themselves. The painter and author Emily Carr (1871-1945) was of great importance to the West here, although she was long rejected in British Columbia. The world economic crisis brought with it an increasing concern with social problems, the Second World War in turn forced to deal with questions of power, hardship, death and again homecoming. After the war, submitted Merrill Denison (1893-1975) the exaggerated nationalism of a satirical observation, and writers of the Left criticized the political and economic way and the increasing dominance of the United States. At the same time, anticlerical authors became more apparent in Quebec. Under the public optimism of the 1950s and 1960s discovered Malcolm Lowry (1909-1957) (Under the Volcano, 1947) and Ethel Wilson (1888-1980) (Swamp Angel, 1954) alcohol problems and the narrowness of the woman's life at this time.\", 'Material support and a wider public fueled the growth of the literary market in the 1960s, with magazines such as Canadian Literature and the Journal of Canadian Studies appearing, along with more affordable paperback editions. Niche markets emerged, whose audiences could still feed authors. Both the individual cultures, as well as women spoke up increasingly, such as Margaret Atwood.', \"After about 1985, government funds were reduced to a more conservative phase. Publishers like Coach House Press, Deneau, Williams-Wallace had to close. In addition, Canada allowed stronger foreign competition, especially from the US. Authors such as Timothy Findley (1930-2002) tried to defend against restrictions, Indian literature found representatives in Eden Robinson (Haisla, born 1968), Jeannette C. Armstrong (Okanagan), who criticized the school system, the satirist Thomas King (Cherokee , born 1948) or the playwright Tomson Highway (Cree, born 1943). There were also more poetic authors, such as Wayne Keon Turner (Ojibway, born 1976), Rita Joe (Mi'kmaq), Marilyn Dumont (Métis, born 1955) or Alootook Ipellie (Inuit, 1951-2007).\", \"Since the 1970s, interest in Canadian literature has been steadier. Authors such as Leonard Cohen, Pierre Vallières, Margaret Atwood, Michel Tremblay and Michael Ondaatje are also known outside the country's borders. At the same time, a huge market for popular literature within the country emerged, such as that of Joy Fielding or Douglas Coupland (Generation X).\", 'As in most arts, the first immigrants from Europe largely ignored aboriginal art. They brought along in their first residential buildings and fortified courtyards and naturally in the fortifications (for example, Louisbourg) and in urban European traditions. The villages of francophone Canada, as in France, encamped around the church, with the missionary churches and the churches of Quebec serving as models. Stone and wood predominated as materials, bricks are rare. However, as in sculpture, the prevailing styles in France and England were, due to the communication conditions, much delayed. This also applied to the takeover of the classic after the British had conquered Canada.', 'Nevertheless, the painting inevitably took the natives, because they should be presented for reporting at court. They were in part of great accuracy, as the Indian and Inuit portraits of John White (about 1540 to about 1593), or the drawings of Louis Nicolas (Codex canadiensis). At the end of the 18th century, British and Loyalists who had fled the United States brought new influences, which became dominant in new settlements such as Toronto. It even came to a golden age of Québec painting, the style remained European, but the motifs were more Canadian. The Swiss Peter Rindisbacher documented about his journey through the Hudson Bay in the Red River Colony, Paul Kane traveled through half the continent.', 'In architecture, neo-classical and neo-gothic motifs were preferred, as in Europe, but British influence became more and more dominant. With the representative expansion Ottawa and each provincial capital tried to express a specific Canadian tradition. Between 1873 and 1914, historicizing styles prevailed, with the styles brought by other European peoples, such as the Italians, making themselves felt. With industrialization, new types of construction, such as steel bridges or railway stations, penetrated, new materials, especially metals dominated. Then came glass and finally concrete. James Wilson Morrice is considered the father of modernism in painting. In the sculpture historical monuments prevailed on squares, especially war memorials after the First World War. But Europe continued to dominate, right down to Art Deco.', 'The Group of Seven tried to develop a Canadian painting; she took her inspiration from the landscape. As one of the first Emily Carr took not only the specific landscape of the West, but also the grandiose art of the Indians of the Pacific Coast.', 'John Lyman founded the Contemporary Arts Society in 1939, and Cubist influences came through Quebec, where the group of automatists emerged. Against them and the Surrealismus the Plasticiens originated, above all Guido Molinari and Claude Tousignant, structure and color questions stepped more strongly into the foreground. Similarly in Toronto, where Jack Bush and Harold Town opposed abstract expressionism. At the same time, these groups tried to dissociate themselves against the influence of the USA. The same was true of sculptors like Robert Murray or Armand Vaillancourt. On the other hand architecture hardly differs from the international one. The photographer Yousuf Karsh was one of the most important portrait photographers of the 20th century.', 'In fine arts, Canada has made a name for itself in Europe through innovative artists. Jeff Wall, Rodney Graham, Ken Lum, Ian Wallace and Geneviève Cadieux have taken photographic techniques to new heights; Louis-Philippe Demers uses new technologies in his artistic work, and Jana Sterbak has created extraordinary conceptual environments.', 'The production of food depends strongly on the natural conditions. Therefore, the regional kitchens, such as the coastal and grasslands of the prairie provinces, have corresponding priorities. While on the Atlantic coast, the catch of lobster, more precisely lobster-like (Lobster) represents an important industry, it was on the west coast of wild salmon; However, salmon farming almost completely supplanted salmon farming, which means that some salmon species that were to be admired in giant spawning a few years ago have now become endangered species.', 'In addition to dealing with natural resources, cultural differences also play a significant role. The French influence in Québec is not to be overlooked, there are numerous restaurants with the appropriate kitchen. The prairie provinces are heavily influenced by the Midwestern United States, while in the far west there is a strong British influence, where English tea still has its place in everyday life.', \"In the south of Canada, especially on the Niagara Peninsula and in the Okanagan area and in the southeast of Vancouver Iceland in British Columbia, wine is grown. The more than 200 years old winegrowing boomed, as from 1974 new winegrowing licenses were issued for the first time, and because the winegrowing associations (Vintners Quality Alliance) were pushing for higher qualities. Canadian wines account for about half of the country's total consumption, with Vincor International and Andres Wines dominating until 2006. However, Vincor was bought by US wine producer Constellation Brands.\", 'Spirits can only be purchased in special shops or in restaurants called Licensed Premises. Many restaurants allow their guests to bring their own wine, beer or maple syrup. The minimum age for buying alcohol is between 18 and 19 years.', \"By far the dominant coffee and fast food chain is Tim Hortons, a company founded in 1964 in Hamilton, which had 65,000 employees in 2008. [144] The company maintained at the end of 2008 (early 2008) claims 3437 (3257) restaurants, of which 2917 (2857) in Canada and 520 (406) in the United States. The hottest competitor in fast food is McDonald's [146] with 1375 restaurants or in the coffee sector the US company Starbucks.\", \"The sport in Canada is varied and includes many winter and summer sports. [147] As a national sport since 1859 was officially recognized until 1994 only the indigenous roots back Lacrosse. It has been a national summer sport since 1994. Since 1994 ice hockey is the national winter sport. Canada is not only regarded as the motherland of ice hockey, but is also one of the world's most successful countries. Seven Canadian teams are represented in the NHL, the world's most important professional league. Also in the lacrosse Canada is very successful and defeated at the World Lacrosse Championship of 2006 in London, the United States.\", 'The most popular sport in the summer is beside Lacrosse Canadian Football, which is very similar to American football. The championship endgame, the Gray Cup, has the highest ratings on televised sporting events. Baseball, basketball, cricket, curling, football, rugby union and softball are also of interest. The most widely practiced individual sports are ice skating, golf, athletics, wrestling, swimming, skateboarding, skiing, snowboarding and tennis. Since the country has a predominantly cool climate, the successes in winter sports tend to be more numerous than in summer sports.', 'Canada hosted numerous international sporting events, including the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal and the 1988 Winter Olympics in Calgary. The 2010 Winter Olympics were hosted in Vancouver. In addition, Canadian cities hosted four Commonwealth Games and numerous World Cups.', 'In addition, there are mobile holidays, such.

Previously, the country was known as Wakoku (倭国, \"land of the Wa\"), where Wa (倭) was first a demonym and was then used for the country as a whole. Since the character used by the Chinese 倭 can be understood as a \"dwarf\", this was later replaced in Japan by the homophonic 和 \"harmony\". Both characters were also commonly used with the prefix 大 \"big\" to write the historical name Yamato, which in the narrower sense refers to the province of Yamato, the nucleus of the Japanese Empire, and thus pars pro toto in a broader sense, the whole country , Maybe Yamato is identical to the Wa-land Yamatai, which is described in Chinese sources from the 3rd century.',\n",

After Japan was forced to abandon its foreclosure, the state took over in 1898 large parts of the first draft of the German Civil Code. This applied above all to the law of obligations and property law, while in family law and inheritance law more Japanese peculiarities became influential. According to the German Civil Code, the Japanese Civil Code was based on the Pandektensystem. However, bonds were also made under French law, in particular through the deliberations of Gustave Boissonade. The introduction of a Western legal system represented an enormous break with the existing legal tradition in Japan. For example, an idea of \\u200b\\u200bpersonal rights and legal claims was alien to Japanese society. After the Second World War, US law exercised an influence.',\n",
       "              'In Japan, the death penalty is a punishable offense. Surveys show that there is overwhelming support for the death penalty among Japanese society. According to a 1999 study, 79.3% were in favor of the death penalty; but she also experiences criticism. [20] In December 2006, at least four prisoners were executed by hanging. The executions are secret, independent observers are not allowed. Relatives and lawyers are also not informed prior to the execution. [21] Appeal processes last between 10 and 16 years; however, there are also prisoners who have been awaiting the death penalty since the 1960s. According to Amnesty International, at least 87 prisoners sentenced to death sat in Japanese prisons in July 2006. [22] Since 2009, criminal cases involving the death penalty in Japan have been prosecuted for certain serious crimes.']})"

The area of \\u200b\\u200btoday's Germany has been Christianised since the early Middle Ages. In the Franconian period, the proselytizing was completed in the empire of Charlemagne, partly by force.

Thus, the ideological neutrality of the state and the right of self-determination of religious communities is established. On this basis, the relationship between religious communities and the state is in partnership; There is therefore no strict separation of church and state, but in many social and educational-cultural areas, there are interdependencies, for example, church-sponsored but state-co-sponsored sponsorship of kindergartens, schools, hospitals or nursing homes. Likewise, some German parties refer to the Christian tradition of the country. The Christian churches have the status of official churches and are corporations under public law, but sui generis due to the current state church law. The conferred corporate status is intended to give the churches specific scope without being subject to state supervision; instead, the ecclesiastical public mission is partially recognized in church treaties with the Länder or the corresponding regulations in the constitutions, as well as the special, original church power is legally confirmed. Certain Christian churches as well as the Jewish communities charge a church tax, which the state collects against a reimbursement of expenses and forwards it to the respective churches (or to the Central Council of Jews in Germany).

In 1517, Martin Luther pushed through the demand for internal church and theological reforms and an anti-papal attitude the Reformation, which led to the emergence of \"Protestant\" denominations. Catholicism reacted with the Counter-Reformation, but the Protestant church held its own in many parts of the empire.

Radical parties were well received, making it increasingly difficult for the moderate parties to form stable governments. After the landslide victory of the National Socialists in the Reichstag election in 1930, the rapidly changing Chancellor had no more parliamentary majority; their presidential cabinets were dependent on Reich President Paul von Hindenburg and his emergency decrees. The deflationist policy of Reich Chancellor Heinrich Brüning aggravated the economic crisis.

In October 1933 Hitler announced the withdrawal of Germany from the League of Nations. He secured his dominion in the interior by also murdering opponents and former companions within the party, especially on the night of the long knives on June 30, 1934, after which he deposed the SA in favor of the SS, who was unconditionally devoted to him. The Reichswehr generals laid their allegiance to him personally. The Gestapo was used as a political police to fight political and ideological opponents.', 'From the beginning, Hitler had two objectives, a war of aggression and annihilation to create \"living space in the East\" and the persecution of the Jews, which began with discrimination, humiliation and exclusion and ended in the Holocaust. In 1934, the economy began to focus on military armaments through work programs, a stubbornly expansive monetary policy and debt. The reduction in unemployment was welcomed by the population as a redemption of economic promises. The German Jews were getting worse and worse; The Nuremberg Laws of 1935 severely punished relations between \"Aryans\" and Jews as \"racial defilements\". Jews lost all public office, were arbitrarily persecuted, robbed and blackmailed, and eventually given a total ban on employment, all companies were expropriated (\"Aryanization\").

The expansion began with the \"Anschluss\" of Austria in 1938, whereupon Germany was referred to as the \"Greater German Reich\", and the annexation of the Sudetenland first and then in March 1939 of the rest of the Czech Republic, which revealed the hitherto Western policy of appeasement towards Hitler as a mistake ,', \"After the German Reich started its attack on Poland on September 1, 1939, Great Britain and France declared war on Germany.

Hitler's popularity reached its peak.\", 'With the beginning of the war, the situation of the Jews and other persecutees also deteriorated. The exit was banned, the Jews were forced into ghettos and had to carry the \"star of the Jews\". Under insufficient food and disease many died in forced labor. In 1941 began the systematic murder of the Jews. The main task of the SS was to erect extermination camps on former Polish or Soviet territory, in which most of the victims, brought in cattle cars, were immediately gassed (see Aktion Reinhardt). In Auschwitz-Birkenau alone, more than one million people were murdered in this way. In total, the number of murdered Jews amounts to 6.3 million.', 'In the meantime, Hitler had declared war on the Soviet Union (Russia campaign 1941-1945). From June 1941 the army marched on Moscow and was stopped only in December. After the war alliance Japan raided the US Navy in Pearl Harbor the same month, Germany also declared war on the United States. Lack of resources and the superiority of the enemy soon led to the turn of the war, which manifested itself in the lost battle of Stalingrad with the complete exhaustion of the German 6th Army. The more inevitable the defeat became, the harder the policy was led inwards. In the \"total war\" proclaimed in 1943, all production was focused on the war, while the German armies on almost all fronts fell behind and many German cities were destroyed by the bombing. When Soviet armies had already occupied Berlin, Hitler took his own life on 30 April 1945 in the Fiihrer bunker. The unconditional surrender of the Wehrmacht followed on 8 May, the last Reich government was arrested in Flensburg-Mürwik on 23 May 1945.

The German eastern territories, a quarter of the Reichsfläche, were spun off by the Potsdam Agreement and placed at the instigation of Stalin largely under Polish and in northern East Prussia under Soviet administration (Kaliningrad Oblast). The Western powers reluctantly endorsed this approach; most of the German inhabitants of these areas were expelled, a fifth of the former Reich population. The Republic of Austria was restored in the 1938 borders. 1946/1947 Saarland was spun off from the occupation area and placed under direct French administration.', 'The Four Powers initially strove for a common occupation policy. There was agreement on a demilitarization and the so-called denazification; The question as to what democracy meant was the differences between the Soviet Union and the Western powers, which intensified in the beginning of the Cold War. In the three Western zones, the Western Allies placed the mining industry, which is important for reconstruction, under the Ruhr Statute.

Contrary to the reform efforts of recent decades, it is statistically significantly less likely that working-class children will attain the Abitur (Abitur) or higher education qualification than middle and upper-class children. In addition, there would be a lack of individual differentiation and support for both high-performance and weak students.

The de facto capital and largest urban settlement is Tokyo.', 'The formation of the Japanese state began in the 5th century under the cultural influence of the Chinese Empire. Since the 16th century, Japan has been in contact with the West, and since the 19th century, has become a major power, acquiring colonies such as Korea and Taiwan, participating in both world wars and briefly dominating large parts of Southeast and East Asia. Until 1947, the Japanese Empire was a constitutional monarchy based on the monarchical principle, partly based on the Prussian model, with the Japanese emperor as head of state. His aggressive expansionist policies in China prior to and during the Second World War (Pacific War) eventually led to the defeat of the Axis powers in August 1945. In the Japanese state formed under Douglas MacArthur\\'s occupation government since 1947, the sovereign is the people, the supreme organ of state power the parliament whose chambers have since been both elected directly by the people. The emperorship was not abolished, but the emperor as a \"symbol of the state\" reduced to ceremonial tasks without independent authority in state affairs. Apart from Japan, there is no longer a state with an emperor.', \"Japan is counted among the more densely populated countries of Asia and ranks eleven of the world's most populous countries with about 126 million inhabitants. The Japanese population is mainly concentrated in the four main islands and consists of 99% Japanese. Minorities include Koreans, Chinese, Filipinos and Taiwanese. Since the 2000s, several thousand guest workers and asylum seekers from Africa and other Asian countries have been living in Japan. Most inhabitants are followers of Shintoism and Buddhism.\", \"As the historically first industrial nation of Asia, Japan today has a highly developed economy and for many years was the world's second largest economic power behind the United States, with which it has been militarily allied since 1952.

Japan is therefore known as the \"Land of the Rising Sun\". Nippon (に っ ぽ ん) and Nihon (に ほ ん) are both pronounced in the compound term: while Nippon is more commonly used in formal language, Japanese money, stamps, and international events, Nihon is more common in everyday and vernacular languages.', 'The nomenclature of the name comes from the official correspondence of Japanese rulers with the Chinese Sui dynasty (6th-7th centuries) and refers to the eastern location of the country from China. The purely Japanese reading instead of the Sino-Japanese Nihon or Nippon is Hi no Moto (no Kuni) (日 [の] 本 ([の] 国)). Previously, the country was known as Wakoku (倭国, \"land of the Wa\"), where Wa (倭) was first a demonym and was then used for the country as a whole. Since the character used by the Chinese 倭 can be understood as a \"dwarf\", this was later replaced in Japan by the homophonic 和 \"harmony\". Both characters were also commonly used with the prefix 大 \"big\" to write the historical name Yamato, which in the narrower sense refers to the province of Yamato, the nucleus of the Japanese Empire, and thus pars pro toto in a broader sense, the whole country , Maybe Yamato is identical to the Wa-land Yamatai, which is described in Chinese sources from the 3rd century.', 'The name \"Japan\" is an exonym presumably derived from a Mandarin or Wu pronunciation of the characters. For example, Marco Polo used the Chinese term for Japan (Chinese .mw-parser-output .Hant {font-size: 110%} 日本國 / .mw-parser-output .Hans {font-size: 110%} 日本国, Pinyin rìběnguó) as Cipangu again. The older Malay word for Japan, Jepang (now Jepun), was also borrowed from a presumably southern Chinese dialect. Portuguese traders, who came across the term Jepang in Malacca in the 16th century, then brought it to Europe.

The main islands are Hokkaido in the north, the central and largest island of Honshu and then south to the islands of Shikoku and Kyushu. In addition, there are 6848 smaller islands (at least 100 m circumference at high tide), which are concentrated mainly in the Seto Inland Sea and in the chain of Ryukyu Islands. Since Japan is an island nation, it has no direct neighbors. Indirectly, however, Russia, North Korea, South Korea, China and Taiwan border Japan.', \"Across the archipelago runs a mountain range that makes up more than two-thirds of Japan's landmass. The highest mountain in Japan is Mount Fuji on the main island of Honshu, 3776 meters above sea level. Agriculture, industry and settlement are limited to around 20% of the land area. In the great plains, the main concentration areas have developed: Kantō (with Tokyo and Yokohama in the Kantō plane), Kansai or Keihanshin (with Osaka, Kyoto and Kobe in the Osaka plane), Chukyō (with Nagoya in the Nōbi plane ) and Kitakyushu-Fukuoka in the Tsukushi Plain. Due to the lack of flat land mountain slopes are cultivated by terraced field.\", 'The Japanese island chain extends in a long arc from the north (45th parallel, Hokkaidō) to the south (20th latitude, Okinotorishima). Therefore, the climate in Japan is very different; from the cold-temperate climate zone in Hokkaido with cold and snowy winters to the subtropics in Okinawa Prefecture. Added to this is the influence of winds - in winter from the Asian continent to the sea and in summer from the sea to the continent. In late June and early July, much of the annual precipitation falls in the south as a monsoon-type rain front (.mw-parser-output .Hani {font-size: 110%} 梅雨 前線, baiu censen).', 'In early summer, the typhoon season begins, affecting mainly the south and southwestern Japan from hurricanes over the Pacific Ocean (eg Typhoon Tokage and Typhoon Conson in 2004). Statistically, Japan reaches most typhoons in September, although they are the most common in the Pacific region in August. The strongest ever recorded typhoon in Japan was the Ise-wan typhoon of 1959. Its effects were devastating: over 5,000 people were killed. The winds also contribute to Japan being increasingly affected by transnational pollution.', 'Japan can be divided into six main climatic regions because of its wide geography.', \"Japan lies at the geological rupture zone of four tectonic plates of the Earth's crust:\", 'which move against each other with a few centimeters per year. Parts of the Pacific Plate move there under the continental plate of Eurasia, which leads to volcanism and frequent earthquakes. The persistent movement (subduction) of the crustal parts, which leads to a slow reduction of the Pacific, does not permit their large-scale fusion, in contrast to India and the so-called terranees of other continental margins.', 'Of the 240 or so volcanoes in the Pacific Ring of Fire, 40 are active. In the entire region there are almost daily lighter earthquakes, at greater intervals also severe (eg Great Kanto earthquake in 1923, earthquake Kobe 1995 or the Tōhoku earthquake in 2011). Every year on the anniversary of the Kanto earthquake in September, an exercise on civil protection takes place.\\nEspecially Tokyo is exposed to a high earthquake risk (see Tokyo earthquake).', 'On March 11, 2011, a violent earthquake shook the entire state. The Tōhoku earthquake was one of the strongest quakes in Japanese history with a magnitude of 9.0 MW. The quake triggered a tsunami and a series of catastrophic accidents at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant.', 'Over 160,000 people have died from tsunamis in Japan in the last thousand years. The country now has an effective tsunami early warning system through buoys in the Pacific Ocean. Regular training programs are held for the population, many Japanese coastal cities protect themselves by building high dikes. These reinforced concrete ramparts are partially 10 meters high, up to 25 meters deep and equipped with sturdy metal gates.', 'Japan is largely covered by mountain forests. A variety of native species specializes in this environment. Inland Japan has a number of mountain ranges that cross the tree line. Compared to the narrowness of the habitat, there are a variety of species. Due to its position as an offshore island chain, it has developed a flora and fauna that is related to continental Asia but is still highly independent.

The most important are the Shinto, which is derived from the Japanese primitive religion, and the Buddhism, which reached Japan in the 5th or 6th century. Today, more than 80% of the Japanese belong to both major religions at the same time, so the basic religious attitude in Japan is called syncretic.', 'Shinto (German way of the Kami) - often also called Shintoismus - is the belief in the native gods of Japan, which can embody natural forces, but also deified ancestors. Shinto is a polytheistic religion without a founder and without established teachings and is therefore based on a different concept of religion than the so-called monotheistic scroll religions. Otherworldly and moral concepts are also not clearly defined and are strongly influenced by Buddhism or Chinese concepts. Basically, the Shinto is a juxtaposition of local traditions with a common ritual core. Many directions of the Shinto, however, invoke the myths of antiquity. At its center is the sun goddess Amaterasu, from which the family dynasty of the Japanese Tennō derives.', 'Japanese Buddhism is divided into many different sects (schools, schools of thought), almost all of which belong to Mahayana Buddhism. Among the best-known Buddhist schools in Japan are Zen Buddhism, Amitabha Buddhism and Nichiren Buddhism. In the religion of Japan, there are also Chinese influences through Daoism and Confucianism, which were absorbed and integrated by Shinto and Buddhism.', 'Christianity played a certain role in the history of Japan, especially in the 16th and 17th centuries, but today only occupies a marginal position.', 'An important element is the \"New Religions\", which have been spreading ever more widely since the middle of the 19th century and often propagate an idiosyncratic mixture of Shinto, Buddhism and other world religions. Since the Second World War there has been a particularly large religious tolerance for these tendencies, so that currently about 300 such religious communities are officially listed.', 'The founders of modern Western medicine in Japan are Erwin Bälz and Julius Scriba.', \"Japan is one of the countries providing universal health care to its citizens. In Japan, every resident must be legally insured. Health services are provided either by regional or national public hospitals or by private hospitals and clinics. Patients have universal access to each facility, although hospitals tend to charge higher fees for people without a referral. Public health insurance covers the cost of most citizens and pays 70% or more for each care and prescription drug. For the rest, the patients themselves are responsible. The portion paid privately is based on the person's disposable income and can not exceed 30%. The private supplementary health insurance is only available to cover co-payments or uncovered costs and usually provides a fixed fee per day in the hospital. Many health insurance companies in Japan run through the employer. In 2015, Japan spent 10.9% of its health care output, of which 84.1% was government-funded. The biggest problem of the Japanese health care system is the future financing, since due to the progressive aging of the society with strongly growing costs must be counted. [15] [16]\", 'Japan compares favorably to various health indicators in an international comparison. On average, the Japanese had a life expectancy of 84.0 years in 2016. Women had a life expectancy of 87.1 years and men had a life expectancy of 81.0 years. Since 1960, the average life expectancy has been increased by more than 16 years (universal health insurance exists since 1961). Japan had one of the lowest proportions of overweight individuals among developed countries. Child and maternal mortality is very low by international standards and less than 0.1% of the population is HIV positive. On the other hand, the Japanese health care system is less efficient in terms of mental illness. The country has one of the highest suicide rates in the world, and despite reforms that have been initiated, Japanese psychiatric and psychiatric institutions are using outdated methods of dealing with patients.

In the 7th century AD, Japan took over the legal order of China in the fields of state and administrative law with the Ritsuryō. This order was characterized by oral laws, but in which there were no courts and legal professions in the modern sense. After Japan was forced to abandon its foreclosure, the state took over in 1898 large parts of the first draft of the German Civil Code. This applied above all to the law of obligations and property law, while in family law and inheritance law more Japanese peculiarities became influential. According to the German Civil Code, the Japanese Civil Code was based on the Pandektensystem. However, bonds were also made under French law, in particular through the deliberations of Gustave Boissonade. The introduction of a Western legal system represented an enormous break with the existing legal tradition in Japan. For example, an idea of \\u200b\\u200bpersonal rights and legal claims was alien to Japanese society. After the Second World War, US law exercised an influence.', 'In Japan, the death penalty is a punishable offense. Surveys show that there is overwhelming support for the death penalty among Japanese society. According to a 1999 study, 79.3% were in favor of the death penalty; but she also experiences criticism. [20] In December 2006, at least four prisoners were executed by hanging. The executions are secret, independent observers are not allowed. Relatives and lawyers are also not informed prior to the execution. [21] Appeal processes last between 10 and 16 years; however, there are also prisoners who have been awaiting the death penalty since the 1960s.

[51]\", 'With a primary energy consumption of 445.3 million tonnes of oil equivalent in 2016, Japan is the country with the fifth highest energy consumption behind China, the US, India and Russia. The country is also the fifth largest carbon dioxide emitter. Japan is one of the signatories to the Paris Climate Agreement. [52]', 'Japan consumes so much liquefied natural gas (LNG) unlike any other country, is the second largest importer of coal and the third largest of oil.', 'Electricity generation is dominated by gas and coal-fired power plants. Electricity generation in 2015 was 1041 terawatt hours. Of these, 39% came from gas-fired power stations, 33.4% from coal-fired power stations, 9.8% from oil power stations, 8.8% from hydropower stations, 3.4% from photovoltaics, 3.3% from biomass power stations and 2.3% from other power generation. [53]', 'After the nuclear disaster in Fukushima, all nuclear power plants were shut down by 2013, which still accounted for 25% of electricity generation in 2010. In August 2015, the use of nuclear energy resumed. By November 2017, five of 42 reactors had been put back into operation. [54] The Cabinet Abe aims to achieve a share of nuclear power of just under 20%. [55]', 'In addition to solar energy, wind energy, geothermal energy, hydroelectric power, biogas and biomass are promoted. [56]'], 'Infrastructure Edit]': ['Japan has a modern and efficient infrastructure. In the Logistics Performance Index, produced by the World Bank, Japan ranked fifth among 201 countries in 2018. The parameters for transport infrastructure and logistical competence performed particularly well. [57]', 'The well-developed railway lines of Japan have a total length of 27,311 km, of which 20,534 km are electrified. [58] The east-west connection of the Shinkansen is the lifeline of the country. For the Olympic Games in Tokyo 1964, the first route from Tokyo to Osaka was opened. Through lines of the seven successor companies of the privatized state railway JNR, by private railways, intercity buses and ferries, most of the villages and islands are connected to the network. Every major city is connected to the surrounding area by a well-developed local traffic network. Nine metropolises have a subway network, and every major city has a variety of bus routes. Modern monorails were built in several cities, there are also trams, in niches also people mover are used.', 'Rail and local transport fees vary greatly by region and operating company. Single trips are very cheap, especially in big cities, but due to the lack of transport networks and the lack of state subsidies, they can also be relatively high. In long-distance traffic, the surcharges often make the trips expensive. [59]', 'A car in Japan primarily people who live in the countryside or in smaller cities. Since the cities are very densely built, a parking permit (Shakoshōmei) is required for the registration of a motor vehicle. There are around 60 million cars registered in the country. [60] In residential areas, the streets are very narrow and have no sidewalks. Therefore, there are hardly any trucks in the inner-city street scene, since only narrow pickup trucks can drive through the narrow streets.', 'The entire road network in 2015 covered about 1,218,772 km, of which 992,835 km are paved. [61] The Japanese toll motorway network covers around 7000 kilometers and another 2000 are planned. The network is state-owned, but the operating companies were converted into public-owned private companies in 2005 and are expected to be sold. In Japan there is left-hand traffic. In road traffic, the country is one of the safest in the world. In Japan in 2012, there were 4.7 deaths per 100,000 inhabitants. For comparison, in Germany it was 4.3 dead in the same year. A total of 6130 people were killed in road traffic. The country has a worldwide high motorization rate. In 2017, there were 590 motor vehicles per 1000 inhabitants in the country (in Germany there were 610 vehicles). [62]', 'The construction of the road and rail network is very difficult and resource-intensive due to the mountainous interior and the many islands, as many tunnels and bridges are needed. In addition, the infrastructure is constantly endangered by earthquakes, typhoons and volcanic eruptions. Power and telephone lines in Japan are predominantly above ground, in new urban development projects underground. Due to the risk of fire during earthquakes, underground gas pipelines in all urban areas require special attention and are often maintained. Gas stoves and gas water heaters are the norm in Japan. The Japanese infrastructure includes a dense network of disaster warning systems and life rafts.', 'In Japan there are a large number of ports and airports. Due to its isolated location, it handles all international goods trade. Due to the poor accessibility of many places within Japan, they are also used for traveling and for domestic goods transport. The largest airports are Tokyo-Haneda, Tokyo-Narita, Kansai and Chūbu Airport, which was newly opened at EXPO Aichi 2005. Since there is only little flat land available in Japan, both the o. G. Kansai and Aichi airports, as well as the airports Kitakyushu and Kobe built on artificial islands in the sea.', 'The telephone network is also well developed, broadband Internet access is available nationwide and almost every Japanese owns a mobile phone. In Japan, the mobile standard Personal Digital Cellular was used, which is not compatible with the globally widespread GSM standard. Meanwhile, however, the UMTS network in Japan is also outstandingly well developed. Most 3G mobile phones from Europe now work well in Japan, too.', 'In 2016, 115 million Japanese used the internet (91% of the population). Japan also has one of the fastest Internet speeds. [63]'], 'Culture [edit | Edit]': ['In modern Japanese culture, many elements go back to the very own tradition of the country, whereby Japan has preserved its individual character in the circle of industrialized nations.', 'In archeology, the earliest evidence of early cultural history are ceramics of the Jōmon and Yayoi periods. From the 4th century, many elements of Chinese culture came to Japan, first agricultural techniques such as rice cultivation and craft techniques such as bronze forgings and the construction of burial mounds, then from the 7th century also the written culture and the Five Classics, Confucianism and Buddhism.', 'In the Heian period, it came to a first flowering, when the court nobility from the Chinese heritage developed an independent Japanese poetry and literature.', 'In the following epochs, the country was devastated again and again by civil wars, whereby the sword needle, the Bushi (later referred to as Samurai), rose to the most important layer. In addition to the art of war and sword-making, a new form of Buddhism, the Zen, emerged, which bestowed on the warriors.', 'Only in the Edo period in the 17th century, under the Tokugawa, the country came to rest again. The samurai became a bureaucratic layer that preserved their martial virtues in martial arts (bujutsu). The influence of Zen was now also reflected in poetry, garden art, painting (sumi-e) and music. Through peace and economic upswing, the fourth layer, the traders, became wealthy at this time. With no access to social advancement, art dealers sought a way to outdo samurai. They promoted teahouses in which the geishas practiced the tea ceremony, floral art, music and dance. They also promoted the Kabuki Theater. In the cities formed special entertainment districts, especially in Edo, where the daimyo had to spend half the year under the direct control of Shogun.', 'Japan is now experiencing a third heyday of culture in the postwar period, when Japan has created a vibrant pop culture that combines Western influences and Japanese tradition. Anime and manga, Japanese films and pop music are also popular overseas.', \"Education is a high priority in Japan, as in all Confucian countries in Asia. In 2012, public spending on education in the primary to tertiary sector was 3.5 percent of gross domestic product. The country, together with Slovakia, ranks last among the 36 participating countries of the OECD's Indicators of Education Systems program. [64] Many Japanese believe that life can only be achieved with good education. Even in kindergarten, the little ones learn the first few letters, namely the Hiragana alphabet. Before each further step in the Japanese education system is then an entrance examination (middle school (in part), high school, university). Many Japanese mothers are housewives and their main task is to provide their children with a good education. From the generation of daughters, however, many want to make a career with their good education, so that here is a social change in the process.\", 'School education starts in kindergarten, but it is not part of compulsory education. Since Japan places great emphasis on learning and living together, there is a lot of group work in kindergarten and elementary school. The school system is divided into primary school (six years), middle school (three years) and high school (three years), compulsory education is nine years. The school year in Japan always starts on April 1st. School holidays are uniform across the country: two weeks on New Year\\'s Day, two weeks in March / April, six weeks in July / August. Public schools have a five-day week, private schools often have a six-day week. During compulsory education, there is no \"sitting still\", each student is automatically transferred. School uniforms are mandatory at many schools. Each of these schools has its own distinctive uniform.', \"In the 2015 PISA ranking, Japan's students ranked fifth out of 72 countries in mathematics, third in science, and eighth in reading comprehension. Japanese students were among the best of all participating countries. [65] The pressure on Japanese schools is considered very high.\", 'After World War II, research focused entirely on developing new products for the industry. Thereby a very close co-operation took place between the development departments of the big companies and the universities. It is only through reforms in the 1980s that basic research is increasingly being promoted. The current big topic is the development of robots, as the Expo 2005 has shown. The main theme of the social sciences of the 1980s was Nihonjinron, the Japanese attempt to find identity after the rapid changes of the last century and a half.', 'Japan is one of the most innovative countries in the world. In the Global Innovation Index 2017, which measures the innovative capacity of individual countries, Japan ranks 14th out of 130 economies. [66]', 'In the 2017 press freedom ranking released by Reporters Without Borders, Japan ranked 72 out of 180 countries. [67] According to the non-governmental organization, there are \"identifiable problems\" in the country\\'s press freedom situation.', 'Newspapers are still very popular in Japan. There are over 100 different, daily newspapers in total. The two largest newspapers in the world after daily circulation come from Japan (as of 2012): Yomiuri Shimbun (ed. 10.02 million) and Asahi Shimbun (8.04 million). [68]', 'There are six nationwide television networks in the country: NHK (Public Service), Nippon Television (NTV), Tokyo Broadcasting System (TBS), Fuji Network System (FNS), TV Asahi (EX) and TV Tokyo Network (TXN).', \"Japan is a large fishing community and operates whaling, ostensibly with a scientific background through the Institute of Cetacean Research. The killing of whales should allow the study of the stomach contents of the animals. The International Whaling Commission strongly criticized Japan's weak scientific arguments, pointing out that the desired data could not be used to manage whale populations and could also be collected with whale-sparing means (such as faeces and skin samples). The Japanese whaling lobby argues that whales eat too many fish and thus are food competitor of humans.\", 'In December 2007, the Japanese government announced international pressure to halt the hunt for endangered humpback whales. The hunt for minke whales and fin whales will be continued. [69] The hunting result of the fleet around the Nisshin Maru in the Antarctic in the 2007/2008 season was 551 specimens of the non-endangered minke whale, 2008/2009 679 minke and a fin whale and 2009/2010 506 Minke whales and a fin whale.', 'The consumption of whale meat has been declining in Japan for years, so that z. For example, stocks of stored whale meat are constantly increasing: from 1453 tonnes in 1999 to 5093 tonnes in December 2010. [70] In addition, Japan is also the most important market for Icelandic whale meat.', 'Sport has already been demonstrated in Japan in the Asuka period (7th century), when an embassy from Korea was entertained by a sumo match at the court of Empress Kogyoku. The Bushi, the rising warrior class at the end of the Heian era (11th century), also practiced sport in preparation for the fight, primarily sword fighting (kenjutsu), riding (bajutsu), archery (kyūjutsu) and swimming. In the Edo period, a peaceful period, the samurai government officials refined these techniques of martial arts (bujutsu), which were also given a spiritual component through the influence of Zen Buddhism.', 'As part of the Meiji Restoration (second half of the 19th century), Western sports also came to Japan, including athletic sports and team sports such as baseball, the most popular sport today (see baseball in Japan). Beginning of the 20th century, modern martial arts and martial arts were developed from the classic Bujutsu arts, including judo, aikidō and kendo. Karate developed in Okinawa Prefecture.', 'Nowadays, a wide variety of sports are practiced in Japan, primarily in clubs at schools and universities. The island location has made windsurfing and diving very popular. The sport of salarymen is golf. A membership in a golf club, however, can afford only the really good earners. Everywhere in Japan are highly fenced facilities on which the tee can be practiced. Hokkaido and Nagano Prefecture are centers of winter sports.', 'But also rugby and football enjoy increasing popularity in Japan. In the Top League, the highest division of Japanese rugby, playing the highest paid players in Asia and the Rugby National Team of Japan regularly represents the country at the Rugby World Cup. The J1 League, the highest division in Japanese football, is again considered one of the most important football leagues in the world and also the national football team of Japan regularly reaches the participation in the World Cup. Many Japanese footballers such as Hajime Hosogai, Shinji Kagawa or Genki Haraguchi have already established themselves in the top leagues of European football (especially in the German Bundesliga). Japan also hosted the 2002 FIFA World Cup and will host the 2019 Rugby World Cup.', 'The 2020 Summer Olympics will be held in Japan.', \"In Japan, there are sixteen public holidays (Jap. 祝 日, shukujitsu) per year, which are set out in the Public Law of the People's Holiday of 20 July 1948 (kokumin no shukujitsu ni kansuru horsitsu) (国民 の 祝 に す る 法律, kokumin no shukujitsu ni kansuru horsitsu). As in Germany some of these holidays are moving holidays (移動 祝 日, idō shukujitsu), but most holidays are tied to a fixed date.\", 'If a holiday falls on a Sunday, the following Monday is a day off (振 (り) 替 (え) 休 日, furikae kyūjitsu, dt. \"Postponed holiday\"). Every single day that falls between two holidays is also a day off from work (国民 の 休 日, kokumin no kyūjitsu, dt \"citizens\\' day of rest\").', 'In addition to public holidays, there are also a large number of regional commemorative and festive days in Japan.
