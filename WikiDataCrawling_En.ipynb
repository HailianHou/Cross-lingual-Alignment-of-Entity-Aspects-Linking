Raised largely in Hawaii, he also lived for a year of his childhood in the State of Washington and four years in Indonesia. After graduating from Columbia University in 1983, he worked as a community organizer in Chicago. In 1988, he enrolled in Harvard Law School, where he was the first black president of the Harvard Law Review. After graduating, he became a civil rights attorney and a professor, teaching constitutional law at the University of Chicago Law School from 1992 to 2004. He represented the 13th district for three terms in the Illinois Senate from 1997 to 2004, when he ran for the U.S. Senate. He received national attention in 2004 with his March primary win, his well-received July Democratic National Convention keynote address, and his landslide November election to the Senate. In 2008, he was nominated for president a year after his campaign began and after a close primary campaign against Hillary Clinton. He was elected over Republican John McCain and was inaugurated on January 20, 2009.

The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 and Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010 served as economic stimulus amidst the Great Recession. After a lengthy debate over the national debt limit, he signed the Budget Control and the American Taxpayer Relief Acts. In foreign policy, he increased U.S. troop levels in Afghanistan, reduced nuclear weapons with the United States\\u2013Russia New START treaty, and ended military involvement in the Iraq War.

His administration filed briefs that urged the Supreme Court to strike down same-sex marriage bans as unconstitutional (United States v. Windsor and Obergefell v. Hodges); same-sex marriage was fully legalized in 2015 after the Court ruled that a same-sex marriage ban was unconstitutional in Obergefell. He advocated for gun control in response to the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, indicating support for a ban on assault weapons, and issued wide-ranging executive actions concerning climate change and immigration. In foreign policy, he ordered military intervention in Iraq in response to gains made by ISIL after the 2011 withdrawal from Iraq, continued the process of ending U.S. combat operations in Afghanistan in 2016, promoted discussions that led to the 2015 Paris Agreement on global climate change, initiated sanctions against Russia following the invasion in Ukraine and again after Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections, brokered a nuclear deal with Iran, and normalized U.S. relations with Cuba. Obama left office in January 2017 with a 60 percent approval rating and currently resides in Washington, D.C. Since then, his presidency has been favorably ranked by historians and the general public.[2][3] He also had a high global approval rating, and the United States' reputation saw a dramatic upward shift during his presidency.[4]\\n\"\n",

His mother, Ann Dunham (1942\\u20131995), was born in Wichita, Kansas; she was mostly of English descent,[11] with some German, Irish, Scottish, Swiss, and Welsh ancestry.[12] His father, Barack Obama Sr. (1936\\u20131982), was a married Luo Kenyan man from Nyang'oma Kogelo. Obama's parents met in 1960 in a Russian language class at the University of Hawaii at Manoa, where his father was a foreign student on a scholarship.[13][14] The couple married in Wailuku, Hawaii on February 2, 1961, six months before Obama was born.[15][16]\\n\",\n",
      "  \"In late August 1961 (only a few weeks after he was born), Barack and his mother moved to the University of Washington in Seattle, where they lived for a year. During that time, the elder Obama completed his undergraduate degree in economics in Hawaii, graduating in June 1962. He then left to attend graduate school on a scholarship at Harvard University, where he earned an M.A. in economics. Obama's parents divorced in March 1964.[17] Obama Sr. returned to Kenya in 1964, where he married for a third time. He visited his son in Hawaii only once, at Christmas time in 1971,[18] before he was killed in an automobile accident in 1982, when Obama was 21 years old.[19] Recalling his early childhood, Obama said, \\\"That my father looked nothing like the people around me \\u2013 that he was black as pitch, my mother white as milk \\u2013 barely registered in my mind.\\\"[14] He described his struggles as a young adult to reconcile social perceptions of his multiracial heritage.[20]\\n\",\n",
      "  \"In 1963, Dunham met Lolo Soetoro at the University of Hawaii; he was an Indonesian East\\u2013West Center graduate student in geography. The couple married on Molokai on March 15, 1965.[21] After two one-year extensions of his J-1 visa, Lolo returned to Indonesia in 1966. His wife and stepson followed sixteen months later in 1967. The family initially lived in a Menteng Dalam neighborhood in the Tebet subdistrict of south Jakarta. From 1970, they lived in a wealthier neighborhood in the Menteng subdistrict of central Jakarta.[22]\\n\",\n",

      "  \"In 1971, Obama returned to Honolulu to live with his maternal grandparents, Madelyn and Stanley Dunham. He attended Punahou School\\u2014 a private college preparatory school\\u2014 with the aid of a scholarship from fifth grade until he graduated from high school in 1979.[29] In his youth, Obama went by the nickname \\\"Barry\\\".[30] Obama lived with his mother and half-sister, Maya Soetoro, in Hawaii for three years from 1972 to 1975 while his mother was a graduate student in anthropology at the University of Hawaii.[31] Obama chose to stay in Hawaii with his grandparents for high school at Punahou when his mother and half-sister returned to Indonesia in 1975 so his mother could begin anthropology field work.[32] His mother spent most of the next two decades in Indonesia, divorcing Lolo in 1980 and earning a PhD degree in 1992, before dying in 1995 in Hawaii following unsuccessful treatment for ovarian and uterine cancer.[33]\\n\",\n",
      "  \"Obama later reflected on his years in Honolulu and wrote: \\\"The opportunity that Hawaii offered \\u2013 to experience a variety of cultures in a climate of mutual respect \\u2013 became an integral part of my world view, and a basis for the values that I hold most dear.\\\"[34] Obama has also written and talked about using alcohol, marijuana, and cocaine during his teenage years to \\\"push questions of who I was out of my mind\\\".[35] Obama was also a member of the \\\"choom gang\\\", a self-named group of friends that spent time together and occasionally smoked marijuana.[36][37]\\n\",\n",
      "  \"After graduating from high school in 1979, Obama moved to Los Angeles to attend Occidental College. In February 1981, Obama made his first public speech, calling for Occidental to participate in the disinvestment from South Africa in response to that nation's policy of apartheid.[38] In mid-1981, Obama traveled to Indonesia to visit his mother and half-sister Maya, and visited the families of college friends in Pakistan and India for three weeks.[38] Later in 1981, he transferred as a junior to Columbia University in New York City, where he majored in political science with a specialty in international relations[39] and in English literature[40] and lived off-campus on West 109th Street.[41] He graduated with a BA degree in 1983 and worked for about a year at the Business International Corporation, where he was a financial researcher and writer,[42][43] then as a project coordinator for the New York Public Interest Research Group on the City College of New York campus for three months in 1985.[44][45][46]\\n\",\n",

Obama also has roots in Ireland; he met with his Irish cousins in Moneygall in May 2011.[51] In Dreams from My Father, Obama ties his mother's family history to possible Native American ancestors and distant relatives of Jefferson Davis, President of the Confederate States of America during the American Civil War. He also shares distant ancestors in common with George W. Bush and Dick Cheney, among others.[52]\\n\",\n",

When they moved to Washington, D.C., in January 2009, the girls started at the Sidwell Friends School.[66] The Obamas have two Portuguese Water Dogs; the first, a male named Bo, was a gift from Senator Ted Kennedy.[67] In 2013, Bo was joined by Sunny, a female.[68]\\n\",\n",

      "  \"Hillary Diane Rodham Clinton (born October 26, 1947) is an American politician and diplomat who served as the First Lady of the United States from 1993 to 2001, U.S. Senator from New York from 2001 to 2009, 67th United States Secretary of State from 2009 to 2013, and as the Democratic Party's nominee for President of the United States in the 2016 election.\\n\",\n",
      "  \"Born in Chicago, Illinois and raised in the Chicago suburb of Park Ridge, Clinton graduated from Wellesley College in 1969 and earned a Juris Doctor from Yale Law School in 1973. After serving as a congressional legal counsel, she moved to Arkansas and married Bill Clinton in 1975. In 1977, she co-founded Arkansas Advocates for Children and Families. She was appointed the first female chair of the Legal Services Corporation in 1978 and became the first female partner at Rose Law Firm the following year. As First Lady of Arkansas, she led a task force whose recommendations helped reform Arkansas's public schools.\\n\",\n",
      "  \"As First Lady of the United States, Clinton was an advocate for gender equality and healthcare reform. Her marital relationship came under public scrutiny during the Lewinsky scandal, which led her to issue a statement that reaffirmed her commitment to the marriage. In 2000, Clinton was elected as the first female Senator from New York. She was reelected to the Senate in 2006. Running for president in 2008, she won far more delegates than any previous female candidate but lost the Democratic nomination to Barack Obama.[2]\\n\",\n",
      "  \"During her tenure as U.S. Secretary of State in the Obama Administration from 2009 to 2013, Clinton responded to the Arab Spring by advocating military intervention in Libya. She helped to organize a diplomatic isolation and international sanctions regime against Iran in an effort to force curtailment of that country's nuclear program; this would eventually lead to the multinational Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action agreement in 2015. Upon leaving her Cabinet position after Obama's first term, she wrote her fifth book and undertook speaking engagements.\\n\",\n",
      "  \"Clinton made a second presidential run in 2016. She received the most votes and primary delegates in the 2016 Democratic primaries and formally accepted her party's nomination for President of the United States on July 28, 2016 with vice presidential running mate Senator Tim Kaine. She became the first female candidate to be nominated for president by a major U.S. political party. She lost the presidential election to Republican opponent Donald Trump despite winning a plurality of the popular vote.[3] She received more than 65 million votes, the 3rd-highest count in a U.S. presidential election, behind Obama's victories in 2008 and 2012. Following her loss, she wrote her third memoir, What Happened, and launched Onward Together, a political action organization dedicated to fundraising for progressive political groups.[4]\\n\"\n",

      " \"Early life and education\": [\n",
      "  \"Hillary Diane Rodham was born on October 26, 1947, at Edgewater Hospital in Chicago, Illinois.[5][6] She was raised in a United Methodist family that first lived in Chicago. When she was three years old, her family moved to the Chicago suburb of Park Ridge.[7] Her father, Hugh Rodham, was of English and Welsh descent,[8] and managed a small but successful textile business.[9] Her mother, Dorothy Howell, was a homemaker of Dutch, English, French Canadian (from Quebec), Scottish and Welsh descent.[8][10][11] Clinton has two younger brothers, Hugh and Tony.[12]\\n\",\n",
      "  \"As a child, Rodham was a favorite student among her teachers at the public schools that she attended in Park Ridge.[13] She participated swimming and softball and earned numerous badges as a Brownie and a Girl Scout.[13] She has often told a story[14][15][16] of being inspired by U.S. efforts during the Space Race and sending a letter to NASA around 1961 asking what she could do to become an astronaut, only to be informed that women were not being accepted into the program.[17] She attended Maine East High School, where she participated in the student council, the school newspaper and was selected for the National Honor Society.[5][18] She was elected class vice president for her junior year, but then lost the election for class president for her senior year against two boys, one of whom told her that \\\"you are really stupid if you think a girl can be elected president\\\".[19] For her senior year, she and other students were transferred to the then new Maine South High School, where she was a National Merit Finalist and was voted, \\\"most likely to succeed\\\". She graduated in 1965 in the top five percent of her class.[20]\\n\",\n",
      "  \"Rodham's mother wanted her to have an independent, professional career,[11] and her father, who was otherwise a traditionalist, felt that his daughter's abilities and opportunities should not be limited by gender.[21] She was raised in a politically conservative household,[11] and she helped canvass Chicago's South Side at age 13 after the very close 1960 U.S. presidential election. She saw evidence of electoral fraud (such as voting list entries showing addresses that were empty lots) against Republican candidate Richard Nixon,[22] and later volunteered to campaign for Republican candidate Barry Goldwater in the U.S. presidential election of 1964.[23]\\n\",\n",
      "  \"Rodham's early political development was shaped most by her high school history teacher (like her father, a fervent anti-communist), who introduced her to Goldwater's The Conscience of a Conservative and by her Methodist youth minister (like her mother, concerned with issues of social justice), with whom she saw and afterwards briefly met, civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. at a 1962 speech in Chicago's Orchestra Hall.[24]\\n\",\n",
      "  \"In 1965, Rodham enrolled at Wellesley College, where she majored in political science.[25][26] During her freshman year, she served as president of the Wellesley Young Republicans.[27][28] As the leader of this \\\"Rockefeller Republican\\\"-oriented group,[29] she supported the elections of moderate Republicans John Lindsay to Mayor of New York City and Massachusetts Attorney General Edward Brooke to the United States Senate.[30] She later stepped down from this position. In 2003 Clinton would write that her views concerning the American Civil Rights Movement and the Vietnam War were changing in her early college years.[27] In a letter to her youth minister at that time, she described herself as \\\"a mind conservative and a heart liberal\\\".[31] In contrast to the factions in the 1960s that advocated radical actions against the political system, she sought to work for change within it.[32][33]\\n\",\n",
      "  \"By her junior year, Rodham became a supporter of the antiwar presidential nomination campaign of Democrat Eugene McCarthy.[34] In early 1968, she was elected president of the Wellesley College Government Association and served through early 1969.[32][35] Following the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr., Rodham organized a two-day student strike and worked with Wellesley's black students to recruit more black students and faculty.[34] In her student government role, she played a role in keeping Wellesley from being embroiled in the student disruptions common to other colleges.[32][36] A number of her fellow students thought she might some day become the first female President of the United States.[32]\\n\",\n",
      "  \"To help her better understand her changing political views, Professor Alan Schechter assigned Rodham to intern at the House Republican Conference and she attended the \\\"Wellesley in Washington\\\" summer program.[34] Rodham was invited by moderate New York Republican Representative Charles Goodell to help Governor Nelson Rockefeller's late-entry campaign for the Republican nomination.[34] Rodham attended the 1968 Republican National Convention in Miami Beach. However, she was upset by the way Richard Nixon's campaign portrayed Rockefeller and by what she perceived as the convention's \\\"veiled\\\" racist messages and left the Republican Party for good.[34]\\nRodham wrote her senior thesis, a critique of the tactics of radical community organizer Saul Alinsky, under Professor Schechter.[37] (Years later, while she was first lady, access to her thesis was restricted at the request of the White House and it became the subject of some speculation. The thesis was later released.[37])\\n\",\n",
      "  \"In 1969, she graduated with a Bachelor of Arts,[38] with departmental honors in political science.[37] After some fellow seniors requested that the college administration allow a student speaker at commencement, she became the first student in Wellesley College history to speak at the event. Her address followed that of commencement speaker Senator Edward Brooke.[35][39] After her speech, she received a standing ovation that lasted seven minutes.[32][40][41] She was featured in an article published in Life magazine,[42][43] due to the response to a part of her speech that criticized Senator Brooke.[39] She also appeared on Irv Kupcinet's nationally syndicated television talk show as well as in Illinois and New England newspapers.[44] That summer, she worked her way across Alaska, washing dishes in Mount McKinley National Park and sliming salmon in a fish processing cannery in Valdez (which fired her and shut down overnight when she complained about unhealthful conditions).[45]\\n\",\n",
      "  \"Rodham then entered Yale Law School, where she served on the editorial board of the Yale Review of Law and Social Action.[46] During her second year, she worked at the Yale Child Study Center,[47] learning about new research on early childhood brain development and working as a research assistant on the seminal work, Beyond the Best Interests of the Child (1973).[48][49] She also took on cases of child abuse at Yale\\u2013New Haven Hospital[48] and volunteered at New Haven Legal Services to provide free legal advice for the poor.[47] In the summer of 1970 she was awarded a grant to work at Marian Wright Edelman's Washington Research Project, where she was assigned to Senator Walter Mondale's Subcommittee on Migratory Labor. There she researched various migrant workers' issues including education, health and housing.[50] Edelman later became a significant mentor.[51] Rodham was recruited by political advisor Anne Wexler to work on the 1970 campaign of Connecticut U.S. Senate candidate Joseph Duffey, with Rodham later crediting Wexler with providing her first job in politics.[52]\\n\",\n",
      "  \"In the spring of 1971, she began dating Bill Clinton, who was also a law student at Yale. During the summer, she interned at the Oakland, California, law firm of Treuhaft, Walker and Burnstein. The firm was well known for its support of constitutional rights, civil liberties and radical causes (two of its four partners were current or former Communist Party members);[53] Rodham worked on child custody and other cases.[a] Clinton canceled his original summer plans in order to live with her in California;[57] the couple continued living together in New Haven when they returned to law school.[54] The following summer, Rodham and Clinton campaigned in Texas for unsuccessful 1972 Democratic presidential candidate George McGovern.[58] She received a Juris Doctor degree from Yale in 1973,[38] having stayed on an extra year to be with Clinton.[59] He first proposed marriage to her following graduation but she declined, uncertain if she wanted to tie her future to his.[59]\\n\",\n",
      "  \"Rodham began a year of postgraduate study on children and medicine at the Yale Child Study Center.[60] In late 1973 her first scholarly article, \\\"Children Under the Law\\\", was published in the Harvard Educational Review.[61] Discussing the new children's rights movement, the article stated that \\\"child citizens\\\" were \\\"powerless individuals\\\"[62] and argued that children should not be considered equally incompetent from birth to attaining legal age, but instead that courts should presume competence except when there is evidence otherwise, on a case-by-case basis.[63] The article became frequently cited in the field.[64]\\n\"\n",

      " \"Marriage, family, law career and First Lady of Arkansas\": [\n",
      "  \"During her postgraduate studies, Rodham served as staff attorney for Edelman's newly founded Children's Defense Fund in Cambridge, Massachusetts,[65] and as a consultant to the Carnegie Council on Children.[66] In 1974, she was a member of the impeachment inquiry staff in Washington, D.C. and advised the House Committee on the Judiciary during the Watergate scandal.[67] Under the guidance of Chief Counsel John Doar and senior member Bernard W. Nussbaum,[48] Rodham helped research procedures of impeachment and the historical grounds and standards for impeachment.[67] The committee's work culminated with the resignation of President Richard Nixon in August 1974.[67]\\n\",\n",
      "  \"By then, Rodham was viewed as someone with a bright political future. Democratic political organizer and consultant Betsey Wright had moved from Texas to Washington the previous year to help guide Rodham's career.[68] Wright thought she had the potential to become a future senator or president.[69] Meanwhile, boyfriend Bill Clinton had repeatedly asked Rodham to marry him, but she continued to demur.[70] After failing the District of Columbia bar exam[71] and passing the Arkansas exam, Rodham came to a key decision. As she later wrote, \\\"I chose to follow my heart instead of my head\\\".[72] She thus followed Clinton to Arkansas, rather than staying in Washington, where career prospects were brighter. He was then teaching law and running for a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives in his home state. In August 1974, Rodham moved to Fayetteville, Arkansas and became one of only two female faculty members in the School of Law at the University of Arkansas, Fayetteville.[73][74]\\n\",\n",
      "  \"At the university, Rodham taught classes in criminal law, where she was considered to be a rigorous teacher who was tough with her grades.[75] She became the first director of a new legal aid clinic at the school, where she secured support from the local bar association and gained federal funding.[76] In one of her cases, the court required her to serve as defense counsel to a man accused of raping a 12-year-old girl;  after her request to be relieved of the assignment failed, Clinton used an effective defense and directed her client to plead guilty to a much lesser charge. Decades later, the victim said that the defense counsel had put her \\\"through hell\\\" during the legal process; Hillary Clinton has called the trial a \\\"terrible case\\\".[77] During her time in Fayetteville, Rodham and several other women founded the city's first rape crisis center.[76] Rodham still harbored doubts about getting married; she was concerned that her separate identity would be lost and that her accomplishments would be viewed in light of someone else.[78]\\n\",\n",
      "  \"In 1974, Bill Clinton lost a congressional race.[79] Rodham and Bill Clinton bought a house in Fayetteville in the summer of 1975 and she finally agreed to marry him.[80] The wedding took place on October 11, 1975, in a Methodist ceremony in their living room.[81] A story about the marriage in the Arkansas Gazette indicated that she decided to retain the name Hillary Rodham.[81][82] Her motivation was threefold. She wanted to keep the couple's professional lives separate, avoid apparent conflicts of interest, and as she told a friend at the time, \\\"it showed that I was still me.\\\"[83] The decision upset both mothers, who were more traditional.[84]\\n\",\n",
      "  \"In 1976, Rodham temporarily relocated to Indianapolis in order to serve as an Indiana state campaign organizer for the presidential campaign of Jimmy Carter.[85][86] In November 1976, Bill Clinton was elected Arkansas Attorney General, and the couple moved to the state capital of Little Rock.[79] In February 1977, Rodham joined the venerable Rose Law Firm, a bastion of Arkansan political and economic influence.[87] She specialized in patent infringement and intellectual property law[46] while also working pro bono in child advocacy;[88] she rarely performed litigation work in court.[89]\\n\",\n",
      "  \"Rodham maintained her interest in children's law and family policy, publishing the scholarly articles \\\"Children's Policies: Abandonment and Neglect\\\" in 1977[90] and \\\"Children's Rights: A Legal Perspective\\\" in 1979.[91] The latter continued her argument that children's legal competence depended upon their age and other circumstances and that in serious medical rights cases, judicial intervention was sometimes warranted. An American Bar Association chair later said, \\\"Her articles were important, not because they were radically new but because they helped formulate something that had been inchoate.\\\"[63] Historian Garry Wills would later describe her as \\\"one of the more important scholar-activists of the last two decades\\\",[92] while conservatives said her theories would usurp traditional parental authority,[93] would allow children to file frivolous lawsuits against their parents,[63] and exemplified critical legal studies run amok.[94]\\n\",\n",
      "  \"In 1977, Rodham cofounded Arkansas Advocates for Children and Families, a state-level alliance with the Children's Defense Fund.[46][96] Later that year, President Jimmy Carter (for whom Rodham had been the 1976 campaign director of field operations in Indiana)[97] appointed her to the board of directors of the Legal Services Corporation,[98] and she served in that capacity from 1978 until the end of 1981.[99] From mid-1978 to mid-1980,[b] she was the chair of that board, the first woman to have the job.[100] During her time as chair, funding for the Corporation was expanded from $90 million to $300 million; subsequently, she successfully fought President Ronald Reagan's attempts to reduce the funding and change the nature of the organization.[88]\\n\",\n",
      "  \"Following her husband's November 1978 election as Governor of Arkansas, Rodham became that state's First Lady in January 1979. She would hold that title for twelve nonconsecutive years (1979\\u201381, 1983\\u201392). Clinton appointed his wife to be the chair of the Rural Health Advisory Committee the same year,[101] where she secured federal funds to expand medical facilities in Arkansas's poorest areas without affecting doctors' fees.[102]\\n\",\n",
      "  \"In 1979, Rodham became the first woman to be made a full partner of Rose Law Firm.[103] From 1978 until they entered the White House, she had a higher salary than her husband.[104] During 1978 and 1979, while looking to supplement their income, Rodham engaged in the trading of cattle futures contracts;[105] an initial $1,000 investment generated nearly $100,000 when she stopped trading after ten months.[106] At this time, the couple also began their ill-fated investment in the Whitewater Development Corporation real estate venture with Jim and Susan McDougal.[105] Both of these became subjects of controversy in the 1990s.\\n\",\n",
      "  \"On February 27, 1980, Rodham gave birth to her only child, daughter Chelsea. In November 1980, Bill Clinton was defeated in his bid for re-election.[107]\\n\",\n",
      "  \"Two years after leaving office, Bill Clinton returned to his job as Governor of Arkansas after he won the election of 1982. During her husband's campaign, Hillary began to use the name \\\"Hillary Clinton\\\", or sometimes \\\"Mrs. Bill Clinton\\\", to assuage the concerns of Arkansas voters; she also took a leave of absence from Rose Law to campaign for him full-time.[108] During her second stint as First Lady of Arkansas, she made a point of using Hillary Rodham Clinton as her name.[c] She was named chair of the Arkansas Education Standards Committee in 1983, where she sought to reform the state's court-sanctioned public education system.[114][115] In one of the Clinton governorship's most important initiatives, she fought a prolonged but ultimately successful battle against the Arkansas Education Association to establish mandatory teacher testing and state standards for curriculum and classroom size.[101][114] It became her introduction into the politics of a highly visible public policy effort.[82][114] In 1985, she introduced Arkansas's Home Instruction Program for Preschool Youth, a program that helps parents work with their children in preschool preparedness and literacy.[116] She was named Arkansas Woman of the Year in 1983 and Arkansas Mother of the Year in 1984.[117][118]\\n\",\n",
      "  \"Clinton continued to practice law with the Rose Law Firm while she was First Lady of Arkansas. She earned less than the other partners, as she billed fewer hours,[119] but still made more than $200,000 in her final year there.[120] The firm considered her a \\\"rainmaker\\\" because she brought in clients, partly thanks to the prestige she lent it and to her corporate board connections. She was also very influential in the appointment of state judges.[120] Bill Clinton's Republican opponent in his 1986 gubernatorial re-election campaign accused the Clintons of conflict of interest, because Rose Law did state business; the Clintons countered the charge by saying that state fees were walled off by the firm before her profits were calculated.[121]\\n\",\n",
      "  \"From 1982 to 1988, Clinton was on the board of directors, sometimes as chair, of the New World Foundation,[122] which funded a variety of New Left interest groups.[123] From 1987 to 1991, she was the first chair of the American Bar Association's Commission on Women in the Profession, created to address gender bias in the legal profession and induce the association to adopt measures to combat it.[124] She was twice named by The National Law Journal as one of the 100 most influential lawyers in America: in 1988 and in 1991.[125] When Bill Clinton thought about not running again for governor in 1990, Hillary Clinton considered running, but private polls were unfavorable and, in the end, he ran and was re-elected for the final time.[126]\\n\",\n",
      "  \"Clinton served as Chairman of the Board of the Children's Defense Fund[5][127] and on the board of the Arkansas Children's Hospital's Legal Services (1988\\u201392)[128] In addition to her positions with nonprofit organizations, she also held positions on the corporate board of directors of TCBY (1985\\u201392),[129] Wal-Mart Stores (1986\\u201392)[130] and Lafarge (1990\\u201392).[131] TCBY and Wal-Mart were Arkansas-based companies that were also clients of Rose Law.[120][132] Clinton was the first female member on Wal-Mart's board, added following pressure on chairman Sam Walton to name a woman to it.[132] Once there, she pushed successfully for Wal-Mart to adopt more environmentally friendly practices, was largely unsuccessful in a campaign for more women to be added to the company's management and was silent about the company's famously anti-labor union practices.[130][132][133] According to Dan Kaufman, author of The Fall of Wisconsin, awareness of this later became a factor in her loss of credibility with organized labor, helping contribute to her loss in the 2016 election, where slightly less than half of union members voted for Donald Trump.[134][135]\\n\",\n",
      "  \"Clinton received sustained national attention for the first time when her husband became a candidate for the 1992 Democratic presidential nomination. Before the New Hampshire primary, tabloid publications printed assertions that Bill Clinton had engaged in an extramarital affair with Gennifer Flowers.[136] In response, the Clintons appeared together on 60 Minutes, where Bill denied the affair, but acknowledged \\\"causing pain in my marriage\\\".[137] This joint appearance was credited with rescuing his campaign.[138] During the campaign, Hillary made culturally disparaging remarks about Tammy Wynette's outlook on marriage as described in her classic song \\\"Stand by Your Man\\\",[d] and later in the campaign about how she could have chosen to be like women staying home and baking cookies and having teas, but wanted to pursue her career instead.[e] The remarks were widely criticized, particularly by those who were, or defended, stay-at-home mothers and in retrospect, were ill-considered by her own admission. Bill said that in electing him, the nation would \\\"get two for the price of one\\\", referring to the prominent role his wife would assume.[144] Beginning with Daniel Wattenberg's August 1992 The American Spectator article \\\"The Lady Macbeth of Little Rock\\\", Hillary's own past ideological and ethical record came under attack from conservatives.[93] At least twenty other articles in major publications also drew comparisons between her and Lady Macbeth.[145]\\n\"\n",

      "  \"When Bill Clinton took office as president in January 1993, Hillary Rodham Clinton became the First Lady, and her press secretary reiterated that she would be using that form of her name.[c] She was the first inaugural First Lady to have earned a postgraduate degree and to have her own professional career up to the time of entering the White House.[146] She was also the first to have an office in the West Wing of the White House in addition to the usual first lady offices in the East Wing.[60][147] She was part of the innermost circle vetting appointments to the new administration and her choices filled at least eleven top-level positions and dozens more lower-level ones.[148] After Eleanor Roosevelt, Clinton was regarded as the most openly empowered presidential wife in American history.[149][150]\\n\",\n",
      "  \"Some critics called it inappropriate for the first lady to play a central role in matters of public policy. Supporters pointed out that Clinton's role in policy was no different from that of other White House advisors and that voters had been well aware that she would play an active role in her husband's presidency.[151] Bill Clinton's campaign promise of \\\"two for the price of one\\\" led opponents to refer derisively to the Clintons as \\\"co-presidents\\\" or sometimes use the Arkansas label \\\"Billary\\\".[101][152][153] The pressures of conflicting ideas about the role of a first lady were enough to send Hillary Clinton into \\\"imaginary discussions\\\" with the also-politically-active Eleanor Roosevelt.[f] From the time she came to Washington, Hillary also found refuge in a prayer group of the Fellowship that featured many wives of conservative Washington figures.[157][158] Triggered in part by the death of her father in April 1993, she publicly sought to find a synthesis of Methodist teachings, liberal religious political philosophy and Tikkun editor Michael Lerner's \\\"politics of meaning\\\" to overcome what she saw as America's \\\"sleeping sickness of the soul\\\"; that would lead to a willingness \\\"to remold society by redefining what it means to be a human being in the twentieth century, moving into a new millennium.\\\"[159][160]\\n\",\n",
      "  \"In January 1993, President Clinton named Hillary to chair a Task Force on National Health Care Reform, hoping to replicate the success she had in leading the effort for Arkansas education reform.[161] Unconvinced regarding the merits of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), she privately urged that passage of health care reform be given higher priority.[162][163] The recommendation of the task force became known as the Clinton health care plan, a comprehensive proposal that would require employers to provide health coverage to their employees through individual health maintenance organizations. Its opponents quickly derided the plan as \\\"Hillarycare\\\" and it faced opposition from even some Democrats in Congress.[164] Some protesters against the proposed plan became vitriolic and during a July 1994 bus tour to rally support for the plan, Clinton wore a bulletproof vest at times.[164]\\n\",\n",
      "  \"Failing to gather enough support for a floor vote in either the House or the Senate (although Democrats controlled both chambers), the proposal was abandoned in September 1994.[165] Clinton later acknowledged in her memoir that her political inexperience partly contributed to the defeat, but cited many other factors. The First Lady's approval ratings, which had generally been in the high-50s percent range during her first year, fell to 44\\u00a0percent in April 1994 and 35\\u00a0percent by September 1994.[166]\\n\",\n",
      "  \"Republicans made the Clinton health care plan a major campaign issue of the 1994 midterm elections.[167] Republicans saw a net gain of 53 seats in the House election and seven in the Senate election, winning control of both; many analysts and pollsters found the plan to be a major factor in the Democrats' defeat, especially among independent voters.[168] The White House subsequently sought to downplay Clinton's role in shaping policy.[169] Opponents of universal health care would continue to use \\\"Hillarycare\\\" as a pejorative label for similar plans by others.[170]\\n\",\n",
      "  \"Along with Senators Ted Kennedy and Orrin Hatch, Clinton was a force behind the passage of the State Children's Health Insurance Program in 1997, a federal bill that gave state support to children whose parents could not provide them health coverage and conducted outreach efforts on behalf of enrolling children in the program once it became law.[171] She promoted nationwide immunization against childhood diseases and encouraged older women to get a mammogram for breast cancer screening, with coverage provided by Medicare.[172] She successfully sought to increase research funding for prostate cancer and childhood asthma at the National Institutes of Health. The First Lady worked to investigate reports of an illness that affected veterans of the Gulf War, which became known as the Gulf War syndrome.[60]\\n\",\n",

Madison Guaranty later failed and Clinton's work at Rose was scrutinized for a possible conflict of interest in representing the bank before state regulators that her husband had appointed.[194] She said she had done minimal work for the bank.[196] Independent counsels Robert Fiske and Kenneth Starr subpoenaed Clinton's legal billing records; she said she did not know where they were.[197][198] After a two-year search, the records were found in the First Lady's White House book room and delivered to investigators in early 1996.[198] The delayed appearance of the records sparked intense interest and another investigation concerning how they surfaced and where they had been.[198] Clinton's staff attributed the problem to continual changes in White House storage areas since the move from the Arkansas Governor's Mansion.[199] On January 26, 1996, Clinton became the first First Lady to be subpoenaed to testify before a federal grand jury.[197] After several Independent Counsels had investigated, a final report was issued in 2000 that stated there was insufficient evidence that either Clinton had engaged in criminal wrongdoing.[200]\\n\",\n",

The policy, which became known as the Russian reset, led to improved cooperation in several areas during Medvedev's time in office, but relations would worsen considerably following Vladimir Putin's return to the position in 2012.[329] In October 2009, on a trip to Switzerland, Clinton's intervention overcame last-minute snags and saved the signing of an historic Turkish\\u2013Armenian accord that established diplomatic relations and opened the border between the two long-hostile nations.[331][332] In Pakistan, she engaged in several unusually blunt discussions with students, talk show hosts and tribal elders, in an attempt to repair the Pakistani image of the U.S.[186][l] Beginning in 2010, she helped organize a diplomatic isolation and international sanctions regime against Iran, in an effort to force curtailment of that country's nuclear program; this would eventually lead to the multinational Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action being agreed to in 2015.[313][334][335]\\n\",\n",

The attack, questions surrounding the security of the U.S. consulate and the varying explanations given afterward by administration officials for what had happened became politically controversial in the U.S.[384] On October 15, Clinton took responsibility for the question of security lapses and said the differing explanations were due to the inevitable fog of war confusion after such events.[384][385]\\n\",\n",

She defended her actions in response to the incident and, while still accepting formal responsibility, said she had had no direct role in specific discussions beforehand regarding consulate security.[388] Congressional Republicans challenged her on several points, to which she responded. In particular, after persistent questioning about whether or not the administration had issued inaccurate \\\"talking points\\\" after the attack, Clinton responded with the much-quoted rejoinder, \\\"With all due respect, the fact is we had four dead Americans. Was it because of a protest or was it because of guys out for a walk one night who decided that they'd they go kill some Americans? What difference at this point does it make?

Some experts, officials, members of Congress and political opponents contended that her use of private messaging system software and a private server violated State Department protocols and procedures and federal laws and regulations governing recordkeeping requirements.[397] The controversy occurred against the backdrop of Clinton's 2016 presidential election campaign and hearings held by the House Select Committee on Benghazi.[398][399]\\n\",\n",

Clinton had said over a period of months that she kept no classified information on the private server that she set up in her house.[400] Government policy, reiterated in the nondisclosure agreement signed by Clinton as part of gaining her security clearance, is that sensitive information can be considered as classified even if not marked as such.[401] After allegations were raised that some of the emails in question fell into the so-called \\\"born classified\\\" category, an FBI probe was initiated regarding how classified information was handled on the Clinton server.[402] The New York Times reported in February 2016 that nearly 2,100 emails stored on Clinton's server were retroactively marked classified by the State Department.[403] Additionally, the intelligence community's inspector general wrote Congress to say that some of the emails \\\"contained classified State Department information when originated.\\\"[404] In May 2016, the inspector general of the State Department criticized her use of a private email server while secretary of state, stating that she had not requested permission for this and would not have received it if she had asked.[405]\\n\",\n",

National Journal's 2004 study of roll-call votes assigned Clinton a rating of 30 in the political spectrum, relative to the Senate at the time, with a rating of 1 being most liberal and 100 being most conservative.[480] National Journal's subsequent rankings placed her as the 32nd-most liberal senator in 2006 and 16th-most liberal senator in 2007.[481]\\nA 2004 analysis by political scientists Joshua D. Clinton of Princeton University and Simon Jackman and Doug Rivers of Stanford University found her to be likely the sixth-to-eighth-most liberal senator.[482]\\nThe Almanac of American Politics, edited by Michael Barone and Richard E. Cohen, rated her votes from 2003 through 2006 as liberal or conservative, with 100 as the highest rating, in three areas: Economic, Social and Foreign.

Basing her economic philosophy on inclusive capitalism, Clinton proposed a \\\"clawback\\\" that would rescind tax relief and other benefits for companies that move jobs overseas; providing incentives for companies that share profits with employees, communities and the environment, rather than focusing on short-term profits to increase stock value and rewarding shareholders; increasing collective bargaining rights; and placing an \\\"exit tax\\\" on companies that move their headquarters out of America in order to pay a lower tax rate overseas.[488] Clinton currently opposes the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) (though she previously described it as \\\"the gold standard\\\"[489] of trade deals). She supports the U.S. Export-Import Bank and holds that \\\"any trade deal has to produce jobs and raise wages and increase prosperity and protect our security\\\".[490][491] As Senator (2001\\u20132009), her record on trade was mixed, voting in favor of some trade agreements but not others.[490]\\n\",\n",

Books praising Clinton did not sell nearly as well[543] (other than the memoirs written by her and her husband). When she ran for Senate in 2000, a number of fundraising groups such as Save Our Senate and the Emergency Committee to Stop Hillary Rodham Clinton sprang up to oppose her.[544] Van Natta found that Republican and conservative groups viewed her as a reliable \\\"bogeyman\\\" to mention in fundraising letters, on a par with Ted Kennedy and the equivalent of Democratic and liberal appeals mentioning Newt Gingrich.[545]\\n\",\n",
      "  \"Clinton has also been featured in the media and popular culture from a wide spectrum of varying perspectives. In 1995, writer Todd S.

She was raised in the suburban town of Rye, New York.[2] Her father later became president of McCall Corporation, the publisher of the popular women's magazines Redbook and McCall's. She grew up with two elder siblings, Martha (1920\\u20131999) and James (1921\\u20131993), and a younger brother, Scott (b. 1930). Her ancestor Thomas Pierce Jr., an early New England colonist, was also an ancestor of Franklin Pierce, 14th president of the United States. She was a fourth cousin, four times removed, of Franklin Pierce and Henry Wadsworth Longfellow.[3]\",\n",

He named three of his planes after her: Barbara, Barbara II, and Barbara III. When he returned on leave, she had discontinued her studies at Smith College in Northampton, Massachusetts;[2] two weeks later, on January 6, 1945, they were married at the First Presbyterian Church in Rye, New York,[2] with the reception being held at The Apawamis Club.[7]\",\n",

In September 1949, Barbara's parents were in a car accident in New York and her mother was killed. Mrs. Bush was pregnant at the time with her second child, and was advised not to travel to attend the funeral. When the baby was born, she was named Pauline Robinson Bush in honor of Barbara's mother.[8] The Bushes moved to the Los Angeles area for a time, and then to Midland, Texas in 1950. The Bushes would move some 29 times during their marriage.[2] Over time, Bush built a business in the oil industry and joined with colleagues to start up the successful Zapata Corporation. Barbara raised her children while her husband was usually away on business. In 1953, the Bushes' daughter, Robin, died of leukemia.[2]\",\n",
      "  \"When their daughter Dorothy was born in August 1959, the Bushes moved from Midland to Houston. In 1963, George Bush was elected Harris County Republican Party chairman, in the first of what would become many elections. In 1964, he made his first run for a prominent political office\\u2014U.S. Senator from Texas.

      " \"Political life[edit]\": [\n",
      "  \"In 1966, George Bush was elected as a U.S. Representative in Congress from Texas. Barbara raised her children while her husband campaigned and occasionally joined him on the trail. Over the ensuing years, George Bush was elected or appointed to several different positions in the U.S. Congress or the executive branch, or government-related posts, and Barbara Bush accompanied him in each case.\",\n",
      "  \"As the wife of a Congressman, Barbara immersed herself in projects that piqued her interest; the projects included various charities and Republican women's groups in Washington, D.C.[2] Though her husband lost a second bid for the Senate in 1970, President Richard Nixon appointed him the United States Ambassador to the United Nations, which enabled Barbara to begin forming relationships in New York City with prominent diplomats.[2] As the Watergate scandal heated up in 1973, Nixon asked Bush to become Chairman of the Republican National Committee; Barbara advised her husband to reject the offer because of the harsh political climate,[2] but he accepted anyway.\",\n",
      "  \"Nixon's successor, Gerald R. Ford, appointed Bush head of the U.S. Liaison Office in the People's Republic of China in 1974, and the Bushes relocated. She enjoyed the time that she spent in China and often rode bicycles with her husband to explore cities and regions that few Americans had visited.[2] Three years later, Bush was recalled to the U.S. to serve as Director of Central Intelligence during a crucial time of legal uncertainty for the agency. He was not allowed to share classified aspects of his job with Barbara; the ensuing sense of isolation, coupled with her perception that she was not achieving her goals while other women of her time were, plunged her into a depression.[2][9] She did not seek professional help. Instead, she began delivering speeches and presentations about her time spent in the closed-off China, and volunteered at a hospice.[2]\",\n",
      "  \"Barbara Bush defended her husband's experience and personal qualities when he announced his candidacy for President of the United States in 1980. She caused a stir when she said that she supported ratification of the Equal Rights Amendment and was pro-choice on abortion,[2] placing her at odds with the conservative wing of the Republican party, led by California Governor Ronald Reagan. Reagan earned the presidential nomination over her husband, who then accepted Reagan's invitation to be his running mate; the team was elected in 1980.\",\n",
      "  \"Barbara Bush's eight years as Second Lady made her a household name. After her son Neil was diagnosed with dyslexia, she took an interest in literacy issues and began working with several different literacy organizations. She spent much time researching and learning about the factors that contributed to illiteracy\\u2014she believed homelessness was also connected to illiteracy[10]\\u2014and the efforts underway to combat both.[2] She traveled around the country and the world, either with the vice president on official trips or by herself. In 1984, she wrote a children's book, C. Fred's Story, which recounted the adventures of a family as related by their cocker spaniel, C. Fred. She donated all of the book's proceeds to literacy charities.[10]\",\n",
      "  \"By the mid-1980s, Bush was comfortable speaking in front of groups, and she routinely spoke to promote issues in which she believed. She became famous for expressing a sense of humor and self-deprecating wit.[2] During the 1984 presidential campaign, Barbara made headlines when she told the press that she could not say on television what she thought of vice presidential candidate Geraldine Ferraro, but \\\"it rhymes with rich\\\".[11] After receiving criticism for the comment, Bush said she did not intend to insult Ferraro.[12]\",\n",
      "  \"In 1988, Vice President Bush announced his candidacy for President to succeed the term-limited President Reagan. By this time, Barbara had experienced two presidential campaigns, but broke new ground by becoming the third candidate's spouse to speak at the national party convention that nominated her husband (after Eleanor Roosevelt in 1940 and Pat Nixon in 1972).[2] She promised voters that she would be a traditional first lady and campaigned actively for her husband.[10] The campaign at times focused on the large Bush family, and contrasted her with the First Lady, Nancy Reagan, by highlighting her interest in domestic staples such as church, gardening, and time spent with family while placing less emphasis on style sense and fashion; she drew attention to both her famous white hair and disinterest in wearing designer clothes.[2] She generally avoided discussion of political issues during the campaign, particularly those on which she and her husband differed, and those closely involved with the campaign have reported that she was actively involved in campaign strategy.[2] Bush was elected in November 1988 and sworn in on January 20, 1989.\",\n",
      "  \"Family literacy was Barbara Bush's cause as First Lady, and she called it \\\"the most important issue we have\\\".[13] She became involved with many literacy organizations, served on literacy committees and chaired many reading organizations. Eventually, she helped develop the Barbara Bush Foundation for Family Literacy.[14] She continued to be dedicated to eliminating the generational cycle of illiteracy in America by supporting programs where parents and their young children are able to learn together. During the early 1980s, after statistics had shown that foreign-born immigrants from Latin America had nearly quintupled just since 1960, statistics showed that 35 million adults could not read above the eighth-grade level and that 23 million were not able to read beyond a fourth-grade level. Mrs. Bush appeared on The Oprah Winfrey Show to discuss the situation and spoke regularly on Mrs. Bush's Story Time, a national radio program that stressed the importance of reading aloud to children.[2] Her children Jeb Bush and Dorothy Bush Koch serve as co-chairs of the Barbara Bush Foundation for Family Literacy. During her lifetime Mrs. Bush remained active in the foundation and served as honorary chair.[15]\",\n",
      "  \"She was active in the White House Historical Association and worked to revitalize the White House Preservation Fund, which she renamed the White House Endowment Trust. The trust raises funds for the ongoing refurbishment and restoration of the White House. She met her goal of raising $25 million towards the endowment. The White House residence staff generally found Barbara Bush to be the friendliest and most easygoing of the First Ladies with whom they dealt.[16]\",\n",
      "  \"In March 1989, Bush's press office reported that she had Graves' disease.[17] In June of that year, President Bush said of his wife that \\\"...she is doing just fine. And I think her doctors would say the same thing. She's got this Grave's disease under control.\\\"[18]\",\n",
      "  \"Bush was known for her affection for her pet English Springer Spaniel Millie and wrote a children's book about Millie's new litter of puppies. She even included Millie in her official white house portrait, painted by Candace Whittemore Lovely.[19] Barbara Bush became the first U.S. First Lady to become a recipient of the Henry G. Freeman Jr. Pin Money Fund, receiving $36,000, most of which she gave to favorite charities.\",\n",
      "  \"She was struck every day by \\\"how much things had changed\\\" for her and her husband since they became President and First Lady. In place of a limousine, Bush tried to use a smaller car and travel by train and commercial aircraft for out-of-town trips. The heads of Bush's Secret Service detail were partially opposed to her wishes; the agents agreed to the small car but did not approve of the commercial air and train travel. At that time, the number of threats to the First Lady was higher than that of the vice president. Bush still wanted to use public transportation despite the opposition of the Secret Service. She was put-off by the fact that her flights would be delayed while agents checked out the planes and luggage. The plane on which Bush traveled was nicknamed \\\"Bright Star,\\\" in honor of the leukemia foundation her husband and Hugh Liedtke founded after her daughter Robin died.[20]\",\n",
      "  \"She gave the Wellesley College commencement address in 1990; her speech was listed as #45 in American Rhetoric's Top 100 Speeches of the 20th Century (listed by rank).[21]\",\n",
      "  \"During her husband's 1992 presidential campaign, Barbara Bush stated that abortion and homosexuality are personal matters and argued that the Republican Party should not take a stand on it, saying that \\\"The personal things should be left out of, in my opinion, platforms and conventions.\\\" Her personal views on abortion were not known, although her friends reported at that time that she \\\"privately supported abortion rights.\\\"[22] She explained, \\\"I hate abortions, but I just could not make that choice for someone else.\\\"[23]\",\n",
      "  \"When Bush lived in the White House, she disclosed that she was suffering from Graves' disease, which is an overactive thyroid ailment; the condition coincidentally affected her husband. It is rare for two biologically unrelated people in the same household to develop Graves disease within two years of each other.[24]\",\n",
      "  \"Bush was more popular than her immediate predecessor Nancy Reagan and successor Hillary Clinton because she carefully \\\"avoided controversy\\\" and took very few public positions on contentious issues.[25]\",\n",
      "  \"After leaving the White House, she and her husband resided at the River Oaks community in Houston, Texas, and at the Bush compound in Kennebunkport, Maine. Bush described January 20, 1993, the day of Bill Clinton's inauguration, a \\\"tough day\\\" for her and her husband. After returning to Houston, the two were visited by their son, George W. Bush, and at that point, Bush realized that she had not cooked in 12 years. She had difficulty driving a car on her own, and she did not drive far from home for a long time; her husband warned people to get out of the way if they saw her car.[26] A month after her husband left office in February 1993, Bush was surprised when her husband booked them on the \\\"Love Boat\\\" ship Regal Princess.[27] In April 1993, Bush and her husband had breakfast with the former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, who was on an American speaking tour. Thatcher mentioned the most recent celebration of former President Ronald Reagan's birthday at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library and Museum, where he orated the same card twice. Bush read about the incident after Reagan was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease, which she called a \\\"tragedy for both\\\" the Reagans.[28]\",\n",
      "  \"Bush attempted to persuade her son George W. Bush not to run for Governor of Texas in the 1994 gubernatorial election. She was convinced that he could not defeat Ann Richards, but he went on to win the election.[29] Several days after he was sworn in as Governor of Texas, she went to a Distinguished Speakers Event at the LBJ Library for Lady Bird Johnson. There, she was introduced by her son, the new Governor of Texas, and the following day, received a letter from him dated January 18, 1995, in which he asserted that he would not be governor had it not been for her and George H. W. Bush. Mrs. Bush described the letter as having \\\"moved\\\" both her and her husband.[30][31] On September 3, 1995, the Bushes went to Vietnam. This was \\\"unbelievable\\\" to Barbara because she \\\"never expected to set foot in what had been North Vietnam. The Bushes first went to Hanoi and then to Ho Chi Minh City. They met with President L\\u00ea \\u0110\\u1ee9c Anh and party secretary \\u0110\\u1ed7 M\\u01b0\\u1eddi.[32] On September 28, 1995, the Bushes drove to Portland, Maine, for the announcement of the Barbara Bush Children's Hospital. Bush said her life was being stretched, adding, \\\"Long after I am gone this hospital will be there with my name.\\\" The Bushes visited the children there, and Mrs. Bush started to recall her daughter Robin after seeing them. The Bushes returned home early that month.[33]\",\n",
      "  \"Bush campaigned for her son George W. Bush after he announced his presidential campaign in June 1999. Throughout the country, she met with women who supported his campaign, but she remained doubtful of his chances of winning. The resentment toward the campaign continued with her rejection any criticism of her son that was said in her presence. She refused to watch any of the debates, in contrast to her husband, who was willing to listen and watch every debate. This created friction between the couple.[34]\",\n",
      "  \"Several schools have been named for her: three primary schools and two middle schools in Texas and an elementary school in Mesa, Arizona. Also named for her is the Barbara Bush Library in Harris County, Texas,[35] and the Barbara Bush Children's Hospital at Maine Medical Center in Portland, Maine. She served on the Boards of AmeriCares and the Mayo Clinic, and headed the Barbara Bush Foundation for Family Literacy.\",\n",

And he's not, not as understanding of my pettiness about that. But why should we hear about body bags and deaths, and how many, what day it's gonna happen, and how many this or that or what do you suppose? Or, I mean, it's not relevant. So, why should I waste my beautiful mind on something like that, and watch him suffer.[36]\",\n",

Beginning in February 2016, she began campaigning for him in New Hampshire, an early voting state.[46][47] Jeb Bush joked that a town hall meeting attended by his mother featured a larger gathering than town halls prior to her involvement.[48] Concerning her son, she believed that Jeb was nearly too well-mannered,[49] but also was confident that he is \\\"decent and honest, and everything we need in a president.\\\"[48] Bush weighed in on Donald Trump, who was Jeb's rival for the nomination. By her own admission, she said that she could not understand how women \\\"can vote for someone who said what he said about Megyn Kelly\\\".[50][51] She also indicated that she had tired of Trump over the course of the campaign and due to her gender, she was \\\"not crazy about what he says about women.\\\"[52] During the CBS Republican debate in February 2016, Jeb defended his mother by saying she \\\"is the strongest woman I know\\\", to which Trump replied that Bush herself \\\"should be running.\\\"[53]\",\n",

      "  \"George Herbert Walker Bush (born June 12, 1924) is an American politician who served as the 41st President of the United States from 1989 to 1993. Prior to assuming the presidency, Bush served as the 43rd Vice President of the United States from 1981 to 1989. A member of the Republican Party, he had previously been a Congressman, Ambassador and Director of Central Intelligence. During his career in public service, he was known simply as George Bush; since 2001, he has often been referred to as \\\"George H. W. Bush\\\", \\\"Bush 41\\\", or \\\"George Bush Senior\\\" in order to distinguish him from his eldest son, George W. Bush, the 43rd president of the United States. He is the nation's oldest living President and Vice President, as well as the longest-lived President in history.\",\n",
      "  \"A member of the Bush family, he was born in Milton, Massachusetts to Prescott Bush and Dorothy Walker Bush. Following the attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, Bush postponed his university studies, enlisted in the U.S. Navy on his 18th birthday, and became the youngest aviator in the U.S. Navy at the time. He served until September 1945, then attended Yale University. Graduating in 1948, he moved his family to West Texas, where he entered the oil business and became a millionaire by the age of 40 in 1964. Soon after founding his own oil company, Bush became involved in politics and won election to the House of Representatives in 1966. In 1971, President Richard Nixon appointed Bush as Ambassador to the United Nations, and in 1973, Bush became the Chairman of the Republican National Committee. The following year, President Gerald Ford appointed Bush as the ambassador to China and later reassigned Bush to the position of Director of Central Intelligence. Bush ran for president in 1980 but was defeated in the Republican primary by Ronald Reagan. Reagan chose Bush as his running mate, and Bush became vice president after the Reagan\\u2013Bush ticket won the 1980 election. During his eight-year tenure as vice president, Bush headed administration task forces on deregulation and fighting the War on Drugs.\",\n",
      "  \"In 1988, Bush ran a successful campaign to succeed Reagan as President, defeating Democratic opponent Michael Dukakis. Foreign policy drove the Bush presidency: military operations were conducted in Panama and the Persian Gulf; the Berlin Wall fell in 1989, and the Soviet Union dissolved two years later. Though the agreement was not ratified until after he left office, Bush also signed the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), which created a trade bloc consisting of the United States, Canada, and Mexico. Domestically, Bush reneged on a 1988 campaign promise and, after a struggle with Congress, signed an increase in taxes that Congress had passed. In the wake of a weak recovery from an economic recession, along with continuing budget deficits and the diminution of foreign politics as a major issue in a post-Cold War political climate, he lost the 1992 presidential election to Democrat Bill Clinton.\",\n",
      "  \"Bush left office in 1993. His presidential library was dedicated in 1997, and he has been active\\u2014often alongside Bill Clinton\\u2014in various humanitarian activities. With George W. Bush's victory in the 2000 presidential election, Bush and his son became the second father\\u2013son combination to serve as president, following John Adams and John Quincy Adams. Bush's second son, Jeb Bush, served as the 43rd Governor of Florida from 1999 to 2007.\",\n",

      "  \"George Herbert Walker Bush was born at 173 Adams Street in Milton, Massachusetts,[1] on June 12, 1924, to Prescott Sheldon Bush and Dorothy (Walker) Bush. The Bush family moved from Milton to Greenwich, Connecticut, shortly after his birth. Growing up, he used the nickname \\\"Poppy\\\".[2]\",\n",
      "  \"Bush began his formal education at the Greenwich Country Day School in Greenwich. Beginning in 1938, he attended Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts, where he held a number of leadership positions that included president of the senior class, secretary of the student council, president of the community fund-raising group, a member of the editorial board of the school newspaper, and captain of both the varsity baseball and soccer teams.[3]\",\n",
      "  \"The United States formally entered World War II in December 1941, following Japan's surprise attack on Pearl Harbor in Hawaii. Six months later, Bush enlisted into the US. Navy[4] immediately after he graduated from Phillips Academy on his eighteenth birthday. He became a naval aviator training for aircraft carrier landings and takeoffs on the USS Sable.[3][5] After completing the 10-month course, he was commissioned as an ensign in the United States Naval Reserve at Naval Air Station Corpus Christi on June 9, 1943 (just three days before his 19th birthday), which made him the youngest naval aviator to that date.[4]\",\n",
      "  \"In September 1943, he was assigned to Torpedo Squadron (VT-51) as the photographic officer.[4] The following year, his squadron was based on USS\\u00a0San Jacinto as a member of Air Group 51, where his lanky physique earned him the nickname \\\"Skin\\\".[6] During this time, the task force was victorious in one of the largest air battles of World War II: the Battle of the Philippine Sea.[4]\",\n",
      "  \"After Bush's promotion to Lieutenant (junior grade) on August 1, 1944, San Jacinto commenced operations against the Japanese in the Bonin Islands. Bush piloted one of four Grumman TBM Avenger aircraft from VT-51 that attacked the Japanese installations on Chichijima.[7] His crew for the mission, which occurred on September 2, 1944, included Radioman Second Class John Delaney and Lieutenant Junior Grade William White.[4] During their attack, the Avengers encountered intense anti-aircraft fire; Bush's aircraft was hit by flak and his engine caught on fire. Despite the fire in his aircraft, Bush completed his attack and released bombs over his target, scoring several damaging hits.[4] With his engine ablaze, Bush flew several miles from the island, where he and one other crew member on the TBM Avenger bailed out of the aircraft;[8] the other man's parachute did not open.[4] Bush waited for four hours in an inflated raft, while several fighters circled protectively overhead until he was rescued by the lifeguard submarine USS\\u00a0Finback.[4] For the next month, he remained on Finback and participated in the rescue of other pilots. Several of those shot down during the attack were executed, and their livers were eaten by their captors.[9] This experience shaped Bush profoundly, leading him to ask, \\\"Why had I been spared and what did God have for me?\\\"[10]\",\n",
      "  \"In November 1944, Bush returned to San Jacinto and participated in operations in the Philippines until his squadron was replaced and sent home to the United States. Through 1944, he flew 58 combat missions[8] for which he received the Distinguished Flying Cross, three Air Medals, and the Presidential Unit Citation awarded to San Jacinto.[4] Bush was then reassigned to Norfolk Navy Base and put in a training wing for new torpedo pilots. His final assignment was as a naval aviator in a new torpedo squadron, VT-153, based at Naval Air Station Grosse Ile, Michigan. Bush was honorably discharged from the U.S. Navy in September 1945, one month after the unconditional surrender of Japan brought the war to an end.[11]\"\n",

      " \"Marriage and college years\": [\n",
      "  \"When Bush was still in the Navy, he married Barbara Pierce (1925\\u20132018) in Rye, New York on January 6, 1945.[12] The marriage produced six children: George W. (b. 1946), Robin (1949\\u20131953), Jeb (b. 1953), Neil (b. 1955), Marvin (b. 1956), and Doro (b. 1959).[11] At the time of his wife's death on April 17, 2018, George H. W. had been married to Barbara for 73 years; theirs was the longest presidential marriage in American history. They had become the longest-married presidential couple in January 1999 when their marriage surpassed the 54 year (1764\\u20131818) marriage of John and Abigail Adams.[13]\",\n",
      "  \"After Bush received his military discharge, he enrolled at Yale University. He earned an undergraduate degree in economics on an accelerated program that enabled him to graduate in two and a half years, rather than the usual four.[11] He was a member of the Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity and was elected its president.[14] He also captained the Yale baseball team and played in the first two College World Series as a left-handed first baseman.[15] Bush was the team captain during his senior year in 1948, and he met Babe Ruth before a game; the event took place only weeks before Ruth's death. Like his father, he was also a member of the Yale cheerleading squad.[16] Late in his junior year, he was initiated into the Skull and Bones secret society; his father Prescott Bush had been initiated into the same society in 1917. He was elected to Phi Beta Kappa when he graduated from Yale in 1948 with a Bachelor of Arts degree in economics.[17]\"\n",

      " \"Faith\": [\n",
      "  \"Bush's Christian faith was shaped by his upbringing in the Episcopal Church, though by the end of his life his apparent religious beliefs have been considered more in line with Evangelical Christian doctrine and practices. Several key moments in Bush's life led to a deepening of his faith in Jesus Christ, including his narrow escape from Japanese forces in 1944 and the tragic death of his three-year-old child, Robin, in 1953. This strong faith would inspire many themes that later would become apparent in his public life, such as his Thousand Points of Light speech, his support for prayer in schools, and his strong support of the pro-life movement.[18]\",\n",
      "  \"After his wife passed away in April 2018, Bush released a statement through his spokesman, saying in part, \\\"We have faith she is in heaven, and we know life will go on - as she would have it. So cross the Bushes off your worry list.\\\"[19]\"\n",

      " \"Business career\": [\n",
      "  \"After graduating from Yale, Bush moved his young family to West Texas. His father's business connections proved useful as he ventured into the oil business, starting as an oil field equipment salesman[20] for Dresser Industries, a subsidiary of Brown Brothers Harriman (where Prescott Bush had served on the board of directors for 22 years).[21] While working for Dresser, Bush lived in various places with his family: Odessa, Texas; Ventura, Bakersfield and Compton, California; and Midland, Texas.[22] (According to eldest son George W. Bush, then age two, the family lived in one of the few duplexes in Odessa with an indoor bathroom, which they \\\"shared with a couple of hookers\\\".)[23] Bush started the Bush-Overbey Oil Development company in 1951 and in 1953 co-founded the Zapata Petroleum Corporation, an oil company that drilled in the Permian Basin in Texas.[24] In 1954 he was named president of the Zapata Offshore Company, a subsidiary which specialized in offshore drilling.\",\n",
      "  \"In 1959 (shortly after the subsidiary became independent), Bush moved the company and his family from Midland to Houston.[25] He continued serving as president of the company until 1964, and later chairman until 1966, when he won election to the U.S. House of Representatives.[21] By that time, Bush had become a millionaire.[26]\"\n",

      " \"Early political career (1963\\u20131980)\": [\n",
      "  \"Bush's career in politics began in 1963 when he was elected chairman of the Harris County, Texas Republican Party. The following year, he ran against incumbent Democrat Ralph W. Yarborough in the U.S. Senate race. He presented himself as a young Conservative Republican in contrast to the aging liberal Democrat Yarborough. He campaigned against civil rights legislation pending before Congress, stating that he believed it gave too much power to the federal government.[27] Bush lost the election 56% to 44%,[28] though he did outpoll Republican presidential nominee Barry Goldwater, who lost by an overwhelming margin to Lyndon B. Johnson.[27]\",\n",
      "  \"Bush and the Harris County Republicans played a role in the development of the new Republican Party of the late 20th century. First, Bush worked to absorb the John Birch Society members, who were trying to take over the Republican Party. Second, during and after the civil rights movement, Democrats in the South who were committed to segregation left their party, and although the \\\"country club Republicans\\\" had differing ideological beliefs, they found common ground in hoping to expel the Democrats from power.[29]\",\n",
      "  \"In 1966, Bush was elected to a seat in the United States House of Representatives from the 7th District of Texas; he won 57 percent of the ballots cast in a race against Democrat Frank Briscoe, who was the district attorney of Harris County.[30][31] Bush was the first Republican to represent Houston in the U.S. House.[21] Bush's representative district included Tanglewood, the Houston neighborhood that was his residence;[32] his family had moved into Tanglewood in the 1960s.[33] His voting record in the House was generally conservative: Bush voted for the Civil Rights Act of 1968, although it was generally unpopular in his district. He supported the Nixon administration's Vietnam policies, but broke with Republicans on the issue of birth control, which he supported.[21] Despite being a first-term congressman, Bush was appointed to the powerful House Ways and Means Committee, where he voted to abolish the military draft.[26] He was elected to a second term in 1968.[34]\",\n",
      "  \"In 1970, Nixon convinced Bush to relinquish his House seat in order to run for the Senate against Ralph Yarborough, who was a fierce Nixon critic. In the Republican primary, Bush easily defeated conservative Robert J. Morris by a margin of 87.6% to 12.4%.[35] Nixon came to Longview, Texas to campaign for Bush and gubernatorial candidate Paul Eggers, a Dallas lawyer who was a close friend of U.S. Senator John G. Tower.[36] Former Congressman Lloyd Bentsen, a more moderate Democrat and native of Mission in south Texas, defeated Yarborough in the Democratic primary.[26] Yarborough endorsed Bentsen, who defeated Bush, 53.4 to 46.6%.[37] As Bush's congressional career waned, he moved out of Houston and sold his first Tanglewood house, but for periods of time continued to reside in Tanglewood.[33]\",\n",
      "  \"Following his 1970 loss, Bush was well known as a prominent Republican businessman from the \\\"Sun Belt\\\", a group of states in the Southern part of the country.[26] Nixon noticed and appreciated the sacrifice Bush had made of his Congressional position,[21] so he appointed him Ambassador to the United Nations.[17] He was confirmed unanimously by the Senate, and served for two years, beginning in 1971.[21]\",\n",
      "  \"Amidst the Watergate scandal, Nixon asked Bush to become chairman of the Republican National Committee in 1973.[17] Bush accepted, and held this position when the popularity of both Nixon and the Republican Party plummeted.[38] He defended Nixon steadfastly, but later as Nixon's complicity became clear, Bush focused more on defending the Republican Party, while still maintaining loyalty to Nixon. As chairman, Bush formally requested that Nixon eventually resign for the good of the Republican party.[21] Nixon did this on August 9, 1974; Bush noted in his diary that \\\"There was an aura of sadness, like somebody died.... The [resignation] speech was vintage Nixon\\u2014a kick or two at the press\\u2014enormous strains. One couldn't help but look at the family and the whole thing and think of his accomplishments and then think of the shame.... [President Gerald Ford's swearing-in offered] indeed a new spirit, a new lift.\\\"[39]\",\n",
      "  \"President Gerald Ford appointed Bush to be Chief of the U.S. Liaison Office in the People's Republic of China. Since the United States at the time maintained official relations with the Republic of China on Taiwan and not the People's Republic of China, the Liaison Office did not have the official status of an embassy and Bush did not formally hold the position of \\\"ambassador\\\", though he unofficially acted as one. The 14 months that he spent in China were largely seen as beneficial for U.S.-China relations.[21]\",\n",
      "  \"After Ford assumed the presidency, Bush was under serious consideration for being nominated as vice president. Ford eventually narrowed his list to Nelson Rockefeller and Bush. White House Chief of Staff Donald Rumsfeld reportedly preferred Rockefeller over Bush. Rockefeller was finally named and confirmed.[40]\",\n",

He was succeeded by Deputy Director of Central Intelligence E. Henry Knoche, who served as acting Director of Central Intelligence until Stansfield Turner was confirmed.[45]\",\n",

In the contest for the Republican Party nomination, Bush stressed his wide range of government experience, while competing against rivals Senator Howard Baker of Tennessee, Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, Congressman John Anderson of Illinois (who would later run as an independent), Congressman Phil Crane, also of Illinois, former Governor John Connally of Texas, former Minnesota Governor Harold Stassen, and the front-runner Ronald Reagan, former actor, and Governor of California.[40]\",\n",
      "  \"In the primary election, Bush focused almost entirely on the Iowa caucuses, while Reagan ran a more traditional campaign. Bush represented the centrist wing in the GOP, whereas Reagan represented conservatives. Bush famously labeled Reagan's supply side-influenced plans for massive tax cuts \\\"voodoo economics\\\". His strategy proved useful, to some degree, as he won in Iowa with 31.5% to Reagan's 29.4%. After the win, Bush stated that his campaign was full of momentum, or \\\"Big Mo\\\". As a result of the loss, Reagan replaced his campaign manager, reorganized his staff, and concentrated on the New Hampshire primary. The two men agreed to a debate in the state, organized by the Nashua Telegraph, but paid for by the Reagan campaign. Reagan invited the other four candidates as well, but Bush refused to debate them, and eventually they left. The debate proved to be a pivotal moment in the campaign; when the moderator, John Breen, ordered Reagan's microphone turned off, his angry response, \\\"I am paying for this microphone,\\\" struck a chord with the public. Bush ended up losing New Hampshire's primary with 23% to Reagan's 50%. Bush lost most of the remaining primaries as well, and formally dropped out of the race in May of that year.[40]\",\n",

As had become customary, he and his wife moved into the Vice President's residence at Number One Observatory Circle, about two miles from the White House. After selling the house in Tanglewood, the Bushes declared a room in The Houstonian Hotel in Houston as their official voting address.[32] The Bushes attended a large number of public and ceremonial events in their positions, including many state funerals, which became a common joke for comedians. Mrs. Bush found the funerals largely beneficial, saying, \\\"George met with many current or future heads of state at the funerals he attended, enabling him to forge personal relationships that were important to President Reagan.\\\" As the President of the Senate, Bush stayed in contact with members of Congress and kept the president informed on occurrences on Capitol Hill.[40]\",\n",

Reagan's cabinet convened in the White House Situation Room, where they discussed various issues, including the availability of the Nuclear Football. When Bush's plane landed, his aides advised him to proceed directly to the White House by helicopter, as an image of the government still functioning despite the attack. Bush rejected the idea, responding, \\\"Only the President lands on the South Lawn.\\\"[40] This made a positive impression on Reagan,[40] who recovered and returned to work within two weeks.

Bush responded in exasperation, \\\"Oh, the vision thing.\\\"[93] This oft-cited quote became a shorthand for the charge that Bush failed to contemplate or articulate important policy positions in a compelling and coherent manner. The phrase has since become a metonym for any politician's failure to incorporate a greater vision in a campaign, and has often been applied in the media to other politicians or public figures.[94][95]\",\n",

Following the primary, Bush and Dole had a joint media appearance, when the interviewer asked Dole if he had anything to say to Bush, Dole said, in response to the ads, \\\"yeah, stop lying about my record\\\" in an angry tone. This is thought to have hurt Dole's campaign to Bush's benefit. Bush continued seeing victory, winning many Southern primaries as well.[21] Once the multiple-state primaries such as Super Tuesday began, Bush's organizational strength and fundraising lead were impossible for the other candidates to match, and the nomination was his.[26]\",\n",

Bush was dedicated to curbing the deficit, believing that America could not continue to be a leader in the world without doing so. He began an effort to persuade the Democratic controlled Congress to act on the budget; with Republicans believing that the best way was to cut government spending, and Democrats convinced that the only way would be to raise taxes, Bush faced problems when it came to consensus building.[26]\",\n",
      "  \"In the wake of a struggle with Congress, Bush was forced by the Democratic majority to raise tax revenues; as a result, many Republicans felt betrayed because Bush had promised \\\"no new taxes\\\" in his 1988 campaign. Perceiving a means of revenge, Republican congressmen defeated Bush's proposal which would enact spending cuts and tax increases that would reduce the deficit by $500\\u00a0billion over five years. Scrambling, Bush accepted the Democrats' demands for higher taxes and more spending, which alienated him from Republicans and gave way to a sharp decrease in popularity. Bush would later say that he wished he had never signed the bill.[26] Near the end of the 101st Congress, the president and congressional members reached a compromise on a budget package that increased the marginal tax rate and phased out exemptions for high-income taxpayers. Although he originally demanded a reduction in the capital gains tax, Bush relented on this issue as well. This agreement with the Democratic leadership in Congress proved to be a turning point in the Bush presidency; his popularity among Republicans never fully recovered.[21]\",\n",
      "  \"Coming at around the same time as the budget deal, America entered into a mild recession, lasting for six months. Many government programs, such as welfare, increased.[26] As the unemployment rate edged upward in 1991, Bush signed a bill providing additional benefits for unemployed workers.[21] The year 1991 was marked by many corporate reorganizations, which laid off a substantial number of workers. Many now unemployed were Republicans and independents, who had believed that their jobs were secure.\",\n",

By 1992, interest and inflation rates were the lowest in years, but by midyear the unemployment rate reached 7.8%, the highest since 1984. In September 1992, the Census Bureau reported that 14.2% of all Americans lived in poverty.[21] At a press conference in 1990, Bush told reporters that he found foreign policy more enjoyable.[26]\",\n",

He also signed the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act which provides monetary compensation of people who had contracted cancer and a number of other specified diseases as a direct result of their exposure to atmospheric nuclear testing undertaken by the United States during the Cold War, or their exposure to high levels of radon while doing uranium mining. In dealing with the environment, Bush reauthorized the Clean Air Act, requiring cleaner burning fuels. He quarreled with Congress over an eventually signed bill to aid police in capturing criminals, and signed into law a measure to improve the nation's highway system.[26] Bush signed the Immigration Act of 1990,[120] which led to a 40 percent increase in legal immigration to the United States.[121]\",\n",

Reagan sent more than 2,000 American troops to Panama as well.[136] Unlike Reagan, Bush was able to remove Noriega from power, but his administration's unsuccessful post-invasion planning hindered the needs of Panama during the establishment of the young democratic government.[137]\",\n",

Bush then removed an embassy and ambassador from the country, and dispatched additional troops to Panama to prepare the way for an upcoming invasion.[136] Noriega suppressed an October military coup attempt and massive protests in Panama against him, but after a U.S. serviceman was shot by Panamanian forces in December 1989, Bush ordered 24,000 troops into the country with an objective of removing Noriega from power;[138] \\\"Operation Just Cause\\\" was a large-scale American military operation, and the first in more than 40 years that was not related to the Cold War.[137]\",\n",

Iraq made attempts to negotiate a deal that would allow the country to take control of half of Kuwait. Bush rejected this proposal and insisted on a complete withdrawal of Iraqi forces.[26] The planning of a ground operation by US-led coalition forces began forming in September 1990, headed by General Norman Schwarzkopf.[146] Bush spoke before a joint session of the U.S. Congress regarding the authorization of air and land attacks, laying out four immediate objectives: \\\"Iraq must withdraw from Kuwait completely, immediately, and without condition. Kuwait's legitimate government must be restored. The security and stability of the Persian Gulf must be assured. And American citizens abroad must be protected.\\\" He then outlined a fifth, long-term objective: \\\"Out of these troubled times, our fifth objective \\u2013 a new world order \\u2013 can emerge: a new era \\u2013 freer from the threat of terror, stronger in the pursuit of justice, and more secure in the quest for peace.

Allied forces penetrated Iraqi lines and pushed toward Kuwait City while on the west side of the country, forces were intercepting the retreating Iraqi army. Bush made the decision to stop the offensive after a mere 100 hours.[149][150] Critics labeled this decision premature, as hundreds of Iraqi forces were able to escape; Bush responded by saying that he wanted to minimize U.S. casualties. Opponents further charged that Bush should have continued the attack, pushing Hussein's army back to Baghdad, then removing him from power.[26] Bush explained that he did not give the order to overthrow the Iraqi government because it would have \\\"incurred incalculable human and political costs....

Bush needed a renewal of negotiating authority to move forward with the NAFTA trade talks. Such authority would enable the president to negotiate a trade accord that would be submitted to Congress for a vote, thereby avoiding a situation in which the president would be required to renegotiate with trading partners those parts of an agreement that Congress wished to change.[167] While initial signing was possible during his term, negotiations made slow, but steady, progress. President Clinton would go on to make the passage of NAFTA a priority for his administration, despite its conservative and Republican roots\\u2014with the addition of two side agreements\\u2014to achieve its passage in 1993.[168]\",\n",
      "  \"The treaty has since been defended as well as criticized further. The American economy has grown 54% since the adoption of NAFTA in 1993, with 25\\u00a0million new jobs created; this was seen by some as evidence of NAFTA being beneficial to the United States.[169] With talk in early 2008 regarding a possible American withdrawal from the treaty, Carlos M. Gutierrez, current United States Secretary of Commerce, writes, \\\"Quitting NAFTA would send economic shock waves throughout the world, and the damage would start here at home.\\\"[169] But John J. Sweeney, President of the AFL-CIO, wrote in The Boston Globe that \\\"the U.S. trade deficit with Canada and Mexico ballooned to 12 times its pre-NAFTA size, reaching $111\\u00a0billion in 2004.\\\"[170]\",\n",

As a result, many leading Democrats declined to seek their party's presidential nomination. On the negative side, Bush's popularity was reduced by an economic recession and doubts of whether he properly ended the Gulf War.\",\n",

He shocked political pundits by finishing second, with 37% of the vote in the New Hampshire primary. Bush responded by adopting more conservative positions on issues, in an attempt to undermine Buchanan's base.[26] Once he had secured the nomination, Bush faced his Democratic challenger, Arkansas Governor Bill Clinton. Clinton attacked Bush as a politician who was not doing enough to assist the working middle-class and being \\\"out of touch\\\" with the common man, a notion reinforced by reporter Andrew Rosenthal's false report that Bush was \\\"astonished\\\" to see a demonstration of a supermarket scanner.[191][192][193]\",\n",

Ross Perot launched a third party bid, claiming that neither Republicans nor Democrats could eliminate the deficit and make government more efficient.

In doing so, Bush alienated many members of his conservative base, losing their support for his re-election. According to one survey, of the voters who cited Bush's broken \\\"No New Taxes\\\" pledge as \\\"very important\\\", two thirds voted for Bill Clinton.[203] Bush had raised taxes in an attempt to address an increasing budget deficit, which has largely been attributed to the Reagan tax cuts and military spending of the 1980s. The tax revenue increase had not hurt his approval ratings to the extent that it prevented it from reaching 89% during the Gulf War, four months after the tax vote.[204] By February 1991 his approval rating rose to its highest level\\u201489%.[205]\",\n",

      "  \"His ability to gain broad international support for the Gulf War and the war's result were seen as both a diplomatic and military triumph,[101] rousing bipartisan approval,[215] though his decision to withdraw without removing Saddam Hussein left mixed feelings, and attention returned to the domestic front and a souring economy.[216] A New York Times article mistakenly depicted Bush as being surprised to see a supermarket barcode reader;[191][193] the report of his reaction exacerbated the notion that he was \\\"out of touch\\\".[191] Amid the early 1990s recession, his image shifted from \\\"conquering hero\\\" to \\\"politician befuddled by economic matters\\\".[192]\",\n",

A Kuwaiti court later convicted all but one of the defendants. Two months later, in retaliation, Clinton ordered the firing of 23 cruise missiles at Iraqi Intelligence Service headquarters in Baghdad. The day before the strike, U.S. Ambassador to the UN Madeleine Albright went before the Security Council to present evidence of the Iraqi plot.

      "  \"George Walker Bush (born July 6, 1946) is an American politician who served as the 43rd President of the United States from 2001 to 2009. He was also the 46th Governor of Texas from 1995 to 2000.\",\n",
      "  \"Bush was born on July 6, 1946, in New Haven, Connecticut. After graduating from Yale University in 1968 and Harvard Business School in 1975, he worked in the oil industry. Bush married Laura Welch in 1977 and unsuccessfully ran for the U.S. House of Representatives shortly thereafter. He later co-owned the Texas Rangers baseball team before defeating Ann Richards in the 1994 Texas gubernatorial election. Bush was elected President of the United States in 2000 when he defeated Democratic incumbent Vice President Al Gore after a close and controversial win that involved a stopped recount in Florida. He became the fourth person to be elected President while receiving fewer popular votes than his opponent.[3] Bush is a member of a prominent political family and is the eldest son of Barbara and George H. W. Bush, the 41st President of the United States. He is only the second president to assume the nation's highest office after his father, following the footsteps of John Adams and his son, John Quincy Adams.[4] His brother, Jeb Bush, a former Governor of Florida, was a candidate for the Republican presidential nomination in the 2016 presidential election. His paternal grandfather, Prescott Bush, was a United States Senator from Connecticut.\",\n",
      "  \"The September 11 terrorist attacks occurred eight months into Bush's first term. Bush responded with what became known as the Bush Doctrine: launching a \\\"War on Terror\\\", an international military campaign that included the war in Afghanistan in 2001 and the Iraq War in 2003. He signed into law broad tax cuts, the Patriot Act, the No Child Left Behind Act, the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act, Medicare prescription drug benefits for seniors, and funding for the AIDS relief program known as PEPFAR. His tenure included national debates on immigration, Social Security, electronic surveillance, and torture. In the 2004 presidential race, Bush defeated Democratic Senator John Kerry in another relatively close election. After his re-election, Bush received increasingly heated criticism from across the political spectrum[5][6][7] for his handling of the Iraq War, Hurricane Katrina,[8][9][10] and other challenges. Amid this criticism, the Democratic Party regained control of Congress in the 2006 elections. In December 2007, the United States entered its longest post-World War II recession, often referred to as the \\\"Great Recession\\\", prompting the Bush administration to obtain congressional passage of multiple economic programs intended to preserve the country's financial system.\",\n",
      "  \"Nationally, Bush was both one of the most popular and unpopular U.S. Presidents in history, having received the highest recorded presidential approval ratings in the wake of the September 11 attacks, as well as one of the lowest approval ratings during the 2008 financial crisis.[11] Bush finished his term in office in 2009 and returned to Texas, where he had purchased a home in Dallas. In 2010, he published his memoir, Decision Points.[12] His presidential library was opened in 2013. His presidency has been ranked among the worst in historians' polls that were published in the late 2000s and 2010s - He has consistently fallen in the bottom two sextiles. However, his favorability ratings with the public have increased since leaving office.[13][14][15][16]\"\n",

      "  \"George Walker Bush was born on July 6, 1946, at Yale\\u2013New Haven Hospital in New Haven, Connecticut, while his father was a student at Yale.[17] He was the first child of George Herbert Walker Bush (1924-) and his wife, Barbara Pierce (1925-2018). He was raised in Midland and Houston, Texas, with four siblings, Jeb, Neil, Marvin and Dorothy. Another younger sister, Robin, died from leukemia at the age of three in 1953.[18] His grandfather, Prescott Bush, was a U.S. Senator from Connecticut.[19] His father was Ronald Reagan's vice president from 1981 to 1989 and the 41st U.S. president from 1989 to 1993. Bush has English and some German ancestry, along with more distant Dutch, Welsh, Irish, French, and Scottish roots.[20]\",\n",
      "  \"Bush attended public schools in Midland, Texas, until the family moved to Houston after he had completed seventh grade. He then spent two years at The Kinkaid School, a prep school in Houston.[21]\",\n",
      "  \"Bush attended high school at Phillips Academy, a boarding school in Andover, Massachusetts, where he played baseball and was the head cheerleader during his senior year.[22][23] He attended Yale University (coincidentally located at his place of birth in New Haven, Connecticut) from 1964 to 1968, graduating with a Bachelor of Arts degree in history.[24] During this time, he was a cheerleader and a member of the Delta Kappa Epsilon, serving as the president of the fraternity during his senior year.[25][26][27] Bush became a member of the Skull and Bones society as a senior.[28] Bush was a rugby union player and was on Yale's 1st XV.[29] He characterized himself as an average student.[30] His GPA during his first three years at Yale was 77, and he had a similar average under a nonnumeric rating system in his final year.[31]\",\n",
      "  \"In the fall of 1973, Bush entered Harvard Business School. He graduated in 1975 with an MBA degree. He is the only U.S. president to have earned an MBA.[32]\",\n",
      "  \"Bush was initially engaged to Cathryn Lee Wolfman in 1967, but the engagement eventually fizzled out. Bush and Wolfman remained on good terms after the end of the relationship.[33] While Bush was at a backyard barbecue in 1977, friends introduced him to Laura Welch, a schoolteacher and librarian. After a three-month courtship, she accepted his marriage proposal and they wed on November 5 of that year.[34] The couple settled in Midland, Texas. Bush left his family's Episcopal Church to join his wife's United Methodist Church.[35] On November 25, 1981, Laura Bush gave birth to fraternal twin daughters, Barbara and Jenna.[34]\",\n",
      "  \"Prior to getting married, Bush struggled with multiple episodes of alcohol abuse.[36] In one instance on September 4, 1976, he was pulled over near his family's summer home in Kennebunkport, Maine for driving under the influence of alcohol. He was cited for DUI, fined $150, and got his Maine driver's license briefly suspended.[37] Bush said his wife has had a stabilizing effect on his life,[34] and he attributes her influence to his 1986 decision to give up alcohol.[38] While Governor of Texas, Bush said of his wife, \\\"I saw an elegant, beautiful woman who turned out not only to be elegant and beautiful, but very smart and willing to put up with my rough edges, and I must confess has smoothed them off over time.\\\"[34]\",\n",
      "  \"Bush has been an avid reader throughout his adult life, preferring biographies and histories.[39] During his time as president, Bush read the Bible daily.[40] He also read 14 Lincoln biographies, and during the last three years of his presidency, he reportedly read 186 books. Walt Harrington, a journalist, recalled seeing \\\"books by John Fowles, F. Scott Fitzgerald, James Joyce, and Gore Vidal lying about, as well as biographies of Willa Cather and Queen Victoria\\\" in his home when Bush was a Texas oilman. Other activities include cigar smoking and golf.[41] Since leaving the White House, Bush has also taken up oil painting.[42]\",\n",
      "  \"In May 1968, Bush was commissioned into the Texas Air National Guard.[43] After two years of training in active-duty service,[44] he was assigned to Houston, flying Convair F-102s with the 147th Reconnaissance Wing out of the Ellington Field Joint Reserve Base.[43][45] Critics, including former Democratic National Committee Chairman Terry McAuliffe, have alleged that Bush was favorably treated due to his father's political standing as a member of the House of Representatives, citing his selection as a pilot despite his low pilot aptitude test scores and his irregular attendance.[43] In June 2005, the United States Department of Defense released all the records of Bush's Texas Air National Guard service, which remain in its official archives.[46]\",\n",
      "  \"In late 1972 and early 1973, he drilled with the 187th Fighter Wing of the Alabama Air National Guard. He had moved to Montgomery, Alabama, to work on the unsuccessful U.S. Senate campaign of Republican Winton M. Blount.[47][48] In 1972, Bush was suspended from flying for failure to take a scheduled physical exam.[49] He was honorably discharged from the Air Force Reserve on November 21, 1974.[50]\",\n",
      "  \"In 1977, Bush established Arbusto Energy, a small oil exploration company, although it did not begin operations until the following year.[51][52] He later changed the name to Bush Exploration. In 1984, his company merged with the larger Spectrum 7, and Bush became chairman.[53] The company was hurt by decreased oil prices, and it folded into HKN, Inc.,[53][54] with Bush becoming a member of HKN's board of directors.[53] Questions of possible insider trading involving HKN arose, but a Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) investigation concluded that the information Bush had at the time of his stock sale was not sufficient to constitute insider trading.[53][55]\",\n",
      "  \"In April 1989, Bush arranged for a group of investors to purchase a controlling interest in the Texas Rangers baseball franchise for $89M and invested $500K himself to start. He then served as managing general partner for five years.[56] He actively led the team's projects and regularly attended its games, often choosing to sit in the open stands with fans.[57] Bush's sale of his shares in the Rangers in 1998 brought him over $15\\u00a0million from his initial $800,000 investment.[58]\",\n",
      "  \"In 1978, Bush ran for the House of Representatives from Texas's 19th congressional district. The retiring member, George H. Mahon, had held the district for the Democratic Party since 1935. Bush's opponent, Kent Hance, portrayed him as out of touch with rural Texans, and Bush lost the election with 46.8 percent of the vote to Hance's 53.2 percent.[59]\",\n",
      "  \"Bush and his family moved to Washington, D.C., in 1988 to work on his father's campaign for the U.S. presidency.[60][61] He served as a campaign advisor and liaison to the media, and assisted his father by campaigning across the country.[53] In December 1991, Bush was one of seven people named by his father to run his father's 1992 presidential re-election campaign, as a \\\"campaign advisor\\\".[62] The previous month, his father had asked him to tell White House chief of staff John H. Sununu that he should resign.[63]\"\n",

      "  \"Bush declared his candidacy for the 1994 Texas gubernatorial election at the same time that his brother Jeb sought the governorship of Florida. His campaign focused on four themes: welfare reform, tort reform, crime reduction, and education improvement.[53] Bush's campaign advisers were Karen Hughes, Joe Allbaugh, and Karl Rove.[64]\",\n",
      "  \"After easily winning the Republican primary, Bush faced popular Democratic incumbent Governor Ann Richards.[53][65] In the course of the campaign, Bush pledged to sign a bill allowing Texans to obtain permits to carry concealed weapons. Richards had vetoed the bill, but Bush signed it into law after he became governor.[66] According to The Atlantic Monthly, the race \\\"featured a rumor that she was a lesbian, along with a rare instance of such a tactic's making it into the public record \\u2013 when a regional chairman of the Bush campaign allowed himself, perhaps inadvertently, to be quoted criticizing Richards for 'appointing avowed homosexual activists' to state jobs\\\".[67] The Atlantic, and others, connected the lesbian rumor to Karl Rove,[68] but Rove denied being involved.[69] Bush won the general election with 53.5\\u00a0percent against Richards' 45.9\\u00a0percent.[70]\",\n",
      "  \"Bush used a budget surplus to push through Texas's largest tax-cut, $2 billion.[64] He extended government funding for organizations providing education of the dangers of alcohol and drug use and abuse, and helping to reduce domestic violence.[71] Critics contended that during his tenure, Texas ranked near the bottom in environmental evaluations. Supporters pointed to his efforts to raise the salaries of teachers and improve educational test scores.[53]\",\n",
      "  \"In 1999, Bush signed a law that required electric retailers to buy a certain amount of energy from renewable sources (RPS),[72][73][74] which helped Texas eventually become the leading producer of wind powered electricity in the U.S.[75][76][77]\",\n",
      "  \"In 1998, Bush won re-election with a record[53] 69\\u00a0percent of the vote.[78] He became the first governor in Texas history to be elected to two consecutive four-year terms.[53] For most of Texas history, governors served two-year terms; a constitutional amendment extended those terms to four years starting in 1975.[79] In his second term, Bush promoted faith-based organizations and enjoyed high approval ratings.[53] He proclaimed June 10, 2000, to be Jesus Day in Texas, a day on which he \\\"urge[d] all Texans to answer the call to serve those in need\\\".[80]\",\n",
      "  \"Throughout Bush's first term, he was the focus of national attention as a potential future presidential candidate. Following his re-election, speculation soared, and within a year he decided to seek the 2000 Republican presidential nomination.[53]\"\n",

      " \"Presidential campaigns\": [\n",
      "  \"Incumbent Democratic president Bill Clinton was completing his second and final term, and the field for nomination for President of both parties was wide open. Bush was the Governor of Texas in June 1999 when he announced his candidacy for President of the United States. He entered a large field of hopefuls for the Republican Party presidential nomination that included John McCain, Alan Keyes, Steve Forbes, Gary Bauer, Orrin Hatch, Elizabeth Dole, Dan Quayle, Pat Buchanan, Lamar Alexander, John Kasich, and Bob Smith.\",\n",
      "  \"Bush portrayed himself as a compassionate conservative, implying he was more centrist than other Republicans. He campaigned on a platform that included bringing integrity and honor back to the White House, increasing the size of the United States Armed Forces, cutting taxes, improving education, and aiding minorities.[53] By early 2000, the race had centered on Bush and McCain.[53]\",\n",
      "  \"Bush won the Iowa caucuses, and although he was heavily favored to win the New Hampshire primary, he trailed McCain by 19\\u00a0percent and lost that primary. Despite this, Bush regained momentum, and according to political observers, he effectively became the front runner after the South Carolina primary\\u2014which according to The Boston Globe\\u2014made history for his campaign's negativity. The New York Times described it as a smear campaign.[81][82][83]\",\n",
      "  \"On July 25, 2000, Bush surprised some observers when he selected Dick Cheney\\u2014a former White House Chief of Staff, U.S. Representative, and Secretary of Defense\\u2014to be his running mate. At the time, Cheney was serving as head of Bush's vice presidential search committee. Soon after at the 2000 Republican National Convention, Bush and Cheney were officially nominated by the Republican Party.\",\n",
      "  \"Bush continued to campaign across the country and touted his record as Governor of Texas.[53] During his campaign, Bush criticized his Democratic opponent, incumbent Vice President Al Gore, over gun control and taxation.[84]\",\n",
      "  \"When the election returns were tallied on November 7, Bush had won 29 states, including Florida. The closeness of the Florida outcome led to a recount.[53] The initial recount also went to Bush, but the outcome was tied up in lower courts for a month until eventually reaching the U.S. Supreme Court.[85] On December 9, in the controversial Bush v. Gore ruling,[86] the Court reversed a Florida Supreme Court decision that had ordered a third count, and stopped an ordered statewide hand recount based on the argument that the use of different standards among Florida's counties violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.[53] The machine recount showed that Bush had won the Florida vote by a margin of 537 votes out of six million cast.[87] Although he had received 543,895 fewer individual nationwide votes than Gore, Bush won the election, receiving 271 electoral votes to Gore's 266 (Gore's statewide victories had electoral votes tallying 267; however, one of Gore's pledged electors abstained, rendering the official tally at 266). Bush was the first person to win an American presidential election with fewer popular votes than another candidate since Benjamin Harrison in 1888.[87]\",\n",
      "  \"In his 2004 bid for re-election, Bush commanded broad support in the Republican Party and did not encounter a primary challenge. He appointed Ken Mehlman as campaign manager, and Karl Rove devised a political strategy.[88] Bush and the Republican platform emphasized a strong commitment to the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan,[89] support for the USA PATRIOT Act,[90] a renewed shift in policy for constitutional amendments banning abortion and same-sex marriage,[89][91] reforming Social Security to create private investment accounts,[89] creation of an ownership society,[89] and opposing mandatory carbon emissions controls.[92] Bush also called for the implementation of a guest worker program for immigrants,[89] which was criticized by conservatives.[93]\",\n",
      "  \"The Bush campaign advertised across the U.S. against Democratic candidates, including Bush's emerging opponent, Massachusetts Senator John Kerry. Kerry and other Democrats attacked Bush on the Iraq War, and accused him of failing to stimulate the economy and job growth. The Bush campaign portrayed Kerry as a staunch liberal who would raise taxes and increase the size of government. The Bush campaign continuously criticized Kerry's seemingly contradictory statements on the war in Iraq,[53] and argued that Kerry lacked the decisiveness and vision necessary for success in the War on Terror.\",\n",
      "  \"In the election, Bush carried 31 of 50 states, receiving a total of 286 electoral votes. He won an absolute majority of the popular vote (50.7\\u00a0percent to his opponent's 48.3\\u00a0percent).[94] Bush's father George H.W. Bush was the previous president who won an absolute majority of the popular vote; he accomplished that feat in the 1988 election. Additionally, it was the first time since Herbert Hoover's election in 1928 that a Republican president was elected alongside re-elected Republican majorities in both Houses of Congress.\"\n",

      "  \"Bush had originally outlined an ambitious domestic agenda, but his priorities were significantly altered following the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks.[95] Wars were waged in Afghanistan and Iraq, and there were significant domestic debates regarding immigration, healthcare, Social Security, economic policy, and treatment of terrorist detainees. Over an eight-year period, Bush's once-high approval ratings[96] steadily declined, while his disapproval numbers increased significantly.[97] In 2007, the United States entered the longest post-World War II recession.[98]\",\n",
      "  \"Bush took office during a period of economic recession in the wake of the bursting of the dot-com bubble.[99] The terrorist attacks also impacted the economy. His administration increased federal government spending from $1.789 trillion to $2.983 trillion (60\\u00a0percent) while revenues increased from $2.025 trillion to $2.524 trillion (from 2000 to 2008). Individual income tax revenues increased by 14\\u00a0percent, corporate tax revenues by 50\\u00a0percent, customs and duties by 40\\u00a0percent. Discretionary defense spending was increased by 107\\u00a0percent, discretionary domestic spending by 62\\u00a0percent, Medicare spending by 131\\u00a0percent, social security by 51\\u00a0percent, and income security spending by 130\\u00a0percent. Cyclically adjusted, revenues rose by 35\\u00a0percent and spending by 65\\u00a0percent.[100]\",\n",

      "  \"The surplus in fiscal year 2000 was $237 billion\\u2014the third consecutive surplus and the largest surplus ever.[103] In 2001, Bush's budget estimated that there would be a $5.6\\u00a0trillion surplus over the next ten years.[104] Facing congressional opposition, Bush held townhall style meetings across the U.S. in order to increase public support for his plan for a $1.35\\u00a0trillion tax cut program\\u2014one of the largest tax cuts in U.S. history.[53] Bush argued that unspent government funds should be returned to taxpayers, saying \\\"the surplus is not the government's money. The surplus is the people's money.\\\"[53] Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan warned of a recession and Bush stated that a tax cut would stimulate the economy and create jobs.[105] Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill, opposed some of the tax cuts on the basis that they would contribute to budget deficits and undermine Social Security.[106] O'Neill disputes the claim, made in Bush's book Decision Points, that he never openly disagreed with him on planned tax cuts.[107] By 2003, the economy showed signs of improvement, though job growth remained stagnant.[53] Another tax cut program was passed that year.\",\n",

The Bush administration pushed for significantly increased regulation of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in 2003,[125] and after two years, the regulations passed the House but died in the Senate. Many Republican senators, as well as influential members of the Bush Administration, feared that the agency created by these regulations would merely be mimicking the private sector's risky practices.[126][127][128] In September 2008, the crisis became much more serious beginning with the government takeover of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac followed by the collapse of Lehman Brothers and a federal bailout of American International Group for $85\\u00a0billion.[129]\",\n",

      "  \"One of the administration's early major initiatives was the No Child Left Behind Act, which aimed to measure and close the gap between rich and poor student performance, provide options to parents with students in low-performing schools, and target more federal funding to low-income schools. This landmark education initiative passed with broad bipartisan support, including that of Senator Ted Kennedy of Massachusetts.[138] It was signed into law by Bush in early 2002.[139] Many contend that the initiative has been successful, as cited by the fact that students in the U.S. have performed significantly better on state reading and math tests since Bush signed \\\"No Child Left Behind\\\" into law.[140] Critics argue that it is underfunded[141] and that NCLBA's focus on \\\"high-stakes testing\\\" and quantitative outcomes is counterproductive.[142]\",\n",

The SCHIP legislation would have significantly expanded federally funded health care benefits and plans to children of some low-income families from about six\\u00a0million to ten\\u00a0million children. It was to be funded by an increase in the cigarette tax.[144] Bush viewed the legislation as a move toward socialized health care, and asserted that the program could benefit families making as much as $83,000 per year who did not need the help.[145]\",\n",
      "  \"Following Republican efforts to pass the Medicare Act of 2003, Bush signed the bill, which included major changes to the Medicare program by providing beneficiaries with some assistance in paying for prescription drugs, while relying on private insurance for the delivery of benefits.[146] The retired persons lobby group AARP worked with the Bush Administration on the program and gave their endorsement. Bush said the law, estimated to cost $400\\u00a0billion over the first ten years, would give the elderly \\\"better choices and more control over their health care\\\".[147]\",\n",
      "  \"Bush began his second term by outlining a major initiative to \\\"reform\\\" Social Security,[148] which was facing record deficit projections beginning in 2005. Bush made it the centerpiece of his domestic agenda despite opposition from some in the U.S. Congress.[148] In his 2005 State of the Union Address, Bush discussed the potential impending bankruptcy of the program and outlined his new program, which included partial privatization of the system, personal Social Security accounts, and options to permit Americans to divert a portion of their Social Security tax (FICA) into secured investments.[148] Democrats opposed the proposal to partially privatize the system.[148]\",\n",
      "  \"Bush embarked on a 60-day national tour, campaigning for his initiative in media events known as \\\"Conversations on Social Security\\\", in an attempt to gain public support.[149] Nevertheless, public support for the proposal declined[150] and the House Republican leadership decided not to put Social Security reform on the priority list for the remainder of their 2005 legislative agenda.[151] The proposal's legislative prospects were further diminished by the fall of 2005 political fallout from Hurricane Katrina.[152] After the Democrats gained control of both houses of Congress as a result of the 2006 midterm elections, there was no prospect of further congressional action on the Bush proposal for the remainder of his term in office.\",\n",

Bush said, \\\"This means that the only thing standing between the American people and these vast oil reserves is action from the U.S. Congress.\\\"[167] Bush had said in June 2008, \\\"In the long run, the solution is to reduce demand for oil by promoting alternative energy technologies. My administration has worked with Congress to invest in gas-saving technologies like advanced batteries and hydrogen fuel cells... In the short run, the American economy will continue to rely largely on oil. And that means we need to increase supply, especially here at home. So my administration has repeatedly called on Congress to expand domestic oil production.\\\"[168]\",\n",

However, Bush did not support embryonic stem cell research.[171] On August 9, 2001, Bush signed an executive order lifting the ban on federal funding for the 71 existing \\\"lines\\\" of stem cells,[172] but the ability of these existing lines to provide an adequate medium for testing has been questioned. Testing can be done on only 12 of the original lines, and all approved lines have been cultured in contact with mouse cells, which creates safety issues that complicate development and approval of therapies from these lines.[173] On July 19, 2006, Bush used his veto power for the first time in his presidency to veto the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act.

Bush also urged Congress to provide additional funds for border security and committed to deploying 6,000 National Guard troops to the Mexico\\u2013United States border.[179] From May to June 2007, Bush strongly supported the Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2007, which was written by a bipartisan group of Senators with the active participation of the Bush administration.[180] The bill envisioned a legalization program for illegal immigrants, with an eventual path to citizenship; establishing a guest worker program; a series of border and work site enforcement measures; a reform of the green card application process and the introduction of a point-based \\\"merit\\\" system for green cards; elimination of \\\"chain migration\\\" and of the Diversity Immigrant Visa; and other measures. Bush argued that the lack of legal status denies the protections of U.S. laws to millions of people who face dangers of poverty and exploitation, and penalizes employers despite a demand for immigrant labor.[181] Bush contended that the proposed bill did not amount to amnesty.[182]\",\n",
      "  \"A heated public debate followed, which resulted in a substantial rift within the Republican Party, most conservatives opposed it because of its legalization or amnesty provisions.[183] The bill was eventually defeated in the Senate on June 28, 2007, when a cloture motion failed on a 46\\u201353 vote.[184] Bush expressed disappointment upon the defeat of one of his signature domestic initiatives.[185] The Bush administration later proposed a series of immigration enforcement measures that do not require a change in law.[186]\",\n",

In 2003, Bush then launched the invasion of Iraq, searching for Weapons of Mass Destruction, which he described as being part of the War on Terrorism.[224] Those invasions led to the toppling of the Taliban regime in Afghanistan and the removal of Saddam Hussein from power in Iraq.\",\n",

In December 2001, the Pentagon reported that the Taliban had been defeated,[242] but cautioned that the war would go on to continue weakening Taliban and al-Qaeda leaders.[242] Later that month the UN had installed the Afghan Transitional Administration chaired by Hamid Karzai.[243][244] In 2002, based on UNICEF figures, Nicholas Kristof reported that \\\"our invasion of Afghanistan may end up saving one million lives over the next decade\\\" as the result of improved healthcare and greater access to humanitarian aid.[245]\",\n",

      "  \"Several historians and commentators hold the view that Bush was one of the most consequential presidents in American history. Princeton University scholar Julian Zelizer described Bush's presidency as a \\\"transformative\\\" one, and said that \\\"some people hate him, some people love him, but I do think he'll have a much more substantive perception as time goes on\\\".[449] Bryon Williams of The Huffington Post referred to Bush as \\\"the most noteworthy president since FDR\\\" and said that the Patriot Act \\\"increased authority of the executive branch at the expense of judicial opinions about when searches and seizures are reasonable\\\" as evidence.[450] Bush's administration presided over the largest tax cuts since the Reagan administration,[451] and his homeland security reforms proved to be the most significant expansion of the federal government since the Great Society.[452] Much of these policies have endured in the administrations of his two immediate successors, Barack Obama and Donald Trump.[453][454] A 2010 Siena Research Institute survey of the opinions of historians, political scientists, and presidential scholars ranked him 39th out of 43 presidents. The survey respondents gave President Bush low ratings on his handling of the U.S. economy, communication, ability to compromise, foreign policy accomplishments, and intelligence.[455]\",\n",
      "  \"Among the public, his reputation has improved somewhat since his presidency ended in 2009. In February 2012, Gallup reported that \\\"Americans still rate George W. Bush among the worst presidents, though their views have become more positive in the three years since he left office.\\\"[456] Gallup had earlier noted that Bush's favorability ratings in public opinion surveys had begun to rise a year after he had left office, from 40\\u00a0percent in January 2009 and 35\\u00a0percent in March 2009, to 45\\u00a0percent in July 2010, a period during which he had remained largely out of the news.[457] Other pollsters have noted similar trends of slight improvement in Bush's personal favorability since the end of his presidency.[458] In April 2013, Bush's approval rating stood at 47\\u00a0percent approval and 50\\u00a0percent disapproval in a poll jointly conducted for The Washington Post and ABC, his highest approval rating since December 2005. Bush had achieved notable gains among seniors, non-college whites, and moderate and conservative Democrats since leaving office, although majorities disapproved of his handling of the economy (53\\u00a0percent) and the Iraq War (57\\u00a0percent).[459] His 47\\u00a0percent approval rating was equal to that of President Obama's in the same polling period.[460] A CNN poll conducted that same month found that 55\\u00a0percent of Americans said Bush's presidency had been a failure, with opinions divided along party lines, and 43\\u00a0percent of independents calling it a success.[461] Bush's public image saw greater improvement starting in 2017, which has been interpreted as Democrats viewing him more favorably in response to Donald Trump's presidency,[462][463] an assessment that has also been expressed by Bush himself.[464]\"\n",

      "  \"John Fitzgerald \\\"Jack\\\" Kennedy (May 29, 1917 \\u2013 November 22, 1963), commonly referred to by his initials JFK, was an American politician who served as the 35th President of the United States from January 1961 until his assassination in November 1963. Kennedy served at the height of the Cold War, and much of his presidency focused on managing relations with the Soviet Union. A member of the Democratic Party, Kennedy represented the state of Massachusetts in the United States House of Representatives and the United States Senate prior to becoming president.\",\n",
      "  \"Kennedy was born in Brookline, Massachusetts, to Joseph P. Kennedy Sr. and Rose Kennedy. A member of the Kennedy family, he graduated from Harvard University in 1940 before joining the U.S. Naval Reserve the following year. During World War II, Kennedy commanded a series of PT boats in the Pacific theater and earned the Navy and Marine Corps Medal for his service. After the war, Kennedy represented the 11th congressional district of Massachusetts in the United States House of Representatives from 1947 until 1953. He was subsequently elected to the U.S. Senate and served as the junior Senator from Massachusetts from 1953 until 1960. While serving in the Senate, he published Profiles in Courage, which won the Pulitzer Prize for Biography. In the 1960 presidential election, Kennedy narrowly defeated Republican opponent Richard Nixon, who was the incumbent Vice President. At age 43, he became the youngest elected president as well as the first and only Roman Catholic to occupy the office.\",\n",
      "  \"Kennedy's time in office was marked by high tensions with communist states in the Cold War. He increased the number of American military advisers in South Vietnam by a factor of 18 over President Dwight D. Eisenhower. In April 1961, he authorized a failed joint-CIA attempt to overthrow the Cuban government of Fidel Castro in the Bay of Pigs Invasion.[2] He subsequently rejected Operation Northwoods plans by the Joint Chiefs of Staff to orchestrate false flag attacks on American soil in order to gain public approval for a war against Cuba. In October 1962, U.S. spy planes discovered that Soviet missile bases had been deployed in Cuba; the resulting period of tensions, termed the Cuban Missile Crisis, nearly resulted in the breakout of a global thermonuclear conflict. Domestically, Kennedy presided over the establishment of the Peace Corps and supported the civil rights movement, but he was largely unsuccessful in passing his New Frontier domestic policies. Kennedy continues to rank highly in historians' polls of U.S. presidents and with the general public. His average approval rating of 70% is the highest of any president in Gallup's history of systematically measuring job approval.[3]\",\n",
      "  \"On November 22, 1963, Kennedy was assassinated in Dallas, Texas. Lee Harvey Oswald was arrested for the state crime, but he was never prosecuted due to his murder by Jack Ruby two days later; Ruby was sentenced to death and died while the sentence was on appeal in 1967. Pursuant to the Presidential Succession Act, Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson was sworn in as president later that day. The FBI and the Warren Commission officially concluded that Oswald was the lone assassin, but various groups challenged the findings of the Warren Report and believed that Kennedy was the victim of a conspiracy. After Kennedy's death, Congress enacted many of his proposals, including the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Revenue Act of 1964.\"\n",

      " \"Early life and education\": [\n",
      "  \"John Fitzgerald Kennedy was born on May 29, 1917, at 83 Beals Street in suburban Brookline, Massachusetts,[4] to businessman/politician Joseph Patrick \\\"Joe\\\" Kennedy and philanthropist/socialite Rose Elizabeth Fitzgerald Kennedy. His grandfathers P. J. Kennedy and Boston Mayor John F. Fitzgerald were both Massachusetts politicians. All four of his grandparents were children of Irish immigrants.[1] Kennedy had an elder brother, Joseph Jr., and seven younger siblings; Rosemary, Kathleen, Eunice, Patricia, Robert, Jean, and Ted.\",\n",
      "  \"Kennedy lived in Brookline for the first ten years of his life and attended the local St. Aidan's Church where he was baptized on June 19, 1917.[5][6] He was educated at the Edward Devotion School in Brookline, the Noble and Greenough Lower School in nearby Dedham, Massachusetts, and the Dexter School (also in Brookline) through the 4th grade. Joe Kennedy's business had kept him away from the family for long stretches of time, and his ventures were concentrated on Wall Street and Hollywood. In September 1927, the family moved from Brookline to Riverdale, Bronx, New York.[7][8] Young John attended the lower campus of Riverdale Country School, a private school for boys, from 5th to 7th grade. Two years later, the family moved to suburban Bronxville, New York, where Kennedy was a member of Boy Scout Troop 2 and attended St. Joseph's Church.[1][9] The Kennedy family spent summers and early autumns[10] at their home (rented in 1926, then purchased in 1929)[11] in Hyannis Port, Massachusetts, and Christmas and Easter holidays at their winter retreat in Palm Beach, Florida, later purchased in 1933. In September 1930, Kennedy\\u2014then 13 years old\\u2014attended the Canterbury School in New Milford, Connecticut, for 8th grade. In April 1931, he had an appendectomy, after which he withdrew from Canterbury and recuperated at home.[12]\",\n",
      "  \"In September 1931, Kennedy attended Choate, a prestigious boarding school in Wallingford, Connecticut, for 9th through 12th grade. His older brother Joe Jr. had already been at Choate for two years and was a football player and leading student. He spent his first years at Choate in his older brother's shadow, and compensated with rebellious behavior that attracted a coterie. They carried out their most notorious stunt by exploding a toilet seat with a powerful firecracker. In the ensuing chapel assembly, the strict headmaster, George St. John, brandished the toilet seat and spoke of certain \\\"muckers\\\" who would \\\"spit in our sea\\\". The defiant Kennedy took the cue and named his group \\\"The Muckers Club\\\", which included roommate and friend Kirk LeMoyne \\\"Lem\\\" Billings.[13]\",\n",
      "  \"During his years at Choate, Kennedy was beset by health problems that culminated with his emergency hospitalization in 1934 at New Haven Hospital, where doctors thought he might have had leukemia.[14] In June 1934, he was admitted to the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota; the ultimate diagnosis there was colitis.[14] Kennedy graduated from Choate in June of the following year, finishing 64th in a class of 112 students.[8] He had been the business manager of the school yearbook and was voted the \\\"most likely to succeed\\\".[13]\",\n",
      "  \"In September 1935, Kennedy made his first trip abroad when he traveled to London with his parents and his sister Kathleen. He intended to study under Harold Laski at the London School of Economics (LSE), as his older brother had done. Ill-health forced his return to America in October of that year, when he enrolled late and spent six weeks at Princeton University.[15] He was then hospitalized for observation at Peter Bent Brigham Hospital in Boston. He convalesced further at the Kennedy winter home in Palm Beach, then spent the spring of 1936 working as a ranch hand on the 40,000-acre (160\\u00a0km2) Jay Six cattle ranch outside Benson, Arizona.[16] It is reported that ranchman Jack Speiden worked both brothers \\\"very hard\\\".[17][18]\",\n",
      "  \"In 1935, Kennedy briefly attended Princeton University but had to leave after two months due to a gastrointestinal illness. Later, in September 1936, Kennedy enrolled at Harvard College and his application essay stated: \\\"The reasons that I have for wishing to go to Harvard are several. I feel that Harvard can give me a better background and a better liberal education than any other university. I have always wanted to go there, as I have felt that it is not just another college, but is a university with something definite to offer. Then too, I would like to go to the same college as my father. To be a 'Harvard man' is an enviable distinction, and one that I sincerely hope I shall attain.\\\"[19] He produced that year's annual \\\"Freshman Smoker\\\", called by a reviewer \\\"an elaborate entertainment, which included in its cast outstanding personalities of the radio, screen and sports world.\\\"[20] He tried out for the football, golf, and swimming teams and earned a spot on the varsity swimming team.[21] Kennedy also sailed in the Star class and won the 1936 Nantucket Sound Star Championship.[22] In July 1937, Kennedy sailed to France\\u2014taking his convertible\\u2014and spent ten weeks driving through Europe with Billings.[23] In June 1938, Kennedy sailed overseas with his father and older brother to work at the American embassy in London, where his father was President Franklin D. Roosevelt's U.S. Ambassador to the Court of St. James's.[24]\",\n",
      "  \"In 1939, Kennedy toured Europe, the Soviet Union, the Balkans, and the Middle East in preparation for his Harvard senior honors thesis. He then went to Czechoslovakia and Germany before returning to London on September 1, 1939, the day that Germany invaded Poland to mark the beginning of World War II. Two days later, the family was in the House of Commons for speeches endorsing the United Kingdom's declaration of war on Germany. Kennedy was sent as his father's representative to help with arrangements for American survivors of the SS Athenia before flying back to the U.S. from Foynes, Ireland, to Port Washington, New York, on his first transatlantic flight.\",\n",
      "  \"When Kennedy was an upperclassman at Harvard, he began to take his studies more seriously and developed an interest in political philosophy. He made the Dean's List in his junior year.[25] In 1940, Kennedy completed his thesis, \\\"Appeasement in Munich\\\", about British participation in the Munich Agreement. The thesis became a bestseller under the title Why England Slept.[26] In addition to addressing Britain's failure to strengthen its military in the lead-up to World War II, the book also called for an Anglo-American alliance against the rising totalitarian powers. While Kennedy became increasingly supportive of U.S. intervention in World War II, his father's isolationist beliefs resulted in the latter's dismissal as ambassador to the United Kingdom, creating a split between the Kennedy and Roosevelt families.[27]\",\n",
      "  \"In 1940, Kennedy graduated cum laude from Harvard College with a Bachelor of Arts in government, concentrating on international affairs. That fall, he enrolled at the Stanford Graduate School of Business and audited classes there.[28] In early 1941, Kennedy left and helped his father write a memoir of his three years as an American ambassador. He then traveled throughout South America; his itinerary included Colombia, Ecuador and Peru.[29][30]\"\n",

      "  \"In 1940, Kennedy attempted to enter the army's Officer Candidate School, but he was medically disqualified due to his chronic lower back problems. He exercised for months to straighten his back. On September 24, 1941, with the help of the director of the Office of Naval Intelligence (ONI)\\u2014who was the former naval attach\\u00e9 to Joseph Kennedy\\u2014Kennedy joined the United States Naval Reserve. He was commissioned an ensign on October 26, 1941,[31] and joined the staff of the Office of Naval Intelligence in Washington, D.C.[32][33][34]\",\n",
      "  \"In January 1942, Kennedy was assigned to the ONI field office at Headquarters, Sixth Naval District, in Charleston, South Carolina.[33] He attended the Naval Reserve Officer Training School at Northwestern University in Chicago, Illinois, from July 27 to September 27 [32] and then voluntarily entered the Motor Torpedo Boat Squadrons Training Center in Melville, Rhode Island.[33][35] On October 10, he was promoted to lieutenant junior grade.[33] In early November, Kennedy was still mourning the death of his close, childhood friend, Marine Corps Second Lieutenant George Houk Mead, Jr., who had been killed in action at Guadalcanal that August and posthumously awarded the Navy Cross for his bravery. Accompanied by a female acquaintance from a wealthy Newport family, the couple had stopped in Middletown, Rhode Island at the cemetery where the decorated, naval spy, Commander Hugo W. Koehler, USN, had been buried the previous year. Ambling around the plots near the tiny St. Columba's chapel, Kennedy paused over Koehler's white granite cross grave marker and pondered his own mortality, hoping out loud that when his time came, he would not have to die without religion. \\\"But these things can't be faked,\\\" he added. \\\"There's no bluffing.\\\"[36] Two decades later, Kennedy and Koehler's stepson, U.S. Senator Claiborne Pell had become good friends and political allies, although they had been aquaintances since the mid-1930's during their \\\"salad days\\\" on the same Newport debutante party \\\"circuit\\\" and when Pell had dated Kathleen (\\\"Kick\\\") Kennedy.[37] Kennedy completed his training on December 2 and was assigned to Motor Torpedo Squadron FOUR.[32]\",\n",
      "  \"His first command was PT-101 from December 7, 1942, until February 23, 1943:[33] It was a PT boat used for training while Kennedy was an instructor at Melville.[38] He then led three Huckins PT boats\\u2014PT-98, PT-99, and PT-101, which were being relocated from MTBRON 4 in Melville, Rhode Island, back to Jacksonville, Florida, and the new MTBRON 14 (formed February 17, 1943). During the trip south, he was hospitalized briefly in Jacksonville after diving into the cold water to unfoul a propeller. Thereafter, Kennedy was assigned duty in Panama and later in the Pacific theater, where he eventually commanded two more patrol torpedo (PT) boats.[39]\",\n",
      "  \"In April 1943, Kennedy was assigned to Motor Torpedo Squadron TWO.[32] On April 24, he took command of PT-109,[40] which was based at Tulagi Island in the Solomon Islands.[33] On the night of August 1\\u20132, PT-109 was on its 31st mission and performing nighttime patrols near New Georgia in the Solomon Islands with PT-162 and PT-169.[41] Kennedy spotted a Japanese destroyer nearby and attempted to turn to attack, when PT-109 was rammed suddenly at an angle and cut in half by the destroyer Amagiri, costing two PT-109 crew members[42] their lives.[43][33] Kennedy gathered around the wreckage his surviving ten crew members including those injured, to vote on whether to \\\"fight or surrender\\\". Kennedy stated: \\\"There's nothing in the book about a situation like this. A lot of you men have families and some of you have children. What do you want to do? I have nothing to lose.\\\" Shunning surrender, the men swam towards a small island three miles away.[33][44] Despite re-injuring his back in the collision, Kennedy towed a badly burned crewman through the water to the island with a life jacket strap clenched between his teeth,[45] and later to a second island, where his crew was subsequently rescued[33][46] on August 8.[31] Kennedy and Ensign Leonard Thom,[47][48] his executive officer on PT-109, were both later awarded the Navy and Marine Corps Medal for heroism and the Purple Heart Medal for injuries.[49]\",\n",
      "  \"On September 1, 1943, Kennedy returned to duty and took command of the PT-59, a PT boat that had been converted into a gunboat. The plan was to attach one gunboat to each PT boat section.[50] On October 8, Kennedy was promoted to full lieutenant.[51] On November 2, PT-59, which included three former PT-109 crew members, took part with another boat in the successful rescue of 87 marines stranded on two rescue landing craft on the Warrior River at Choiseul Island, which was held by the Japanese.[52] Under doctor's orders, Kennedy was relieved of his command of PT-59 on November 18, and sent to the hospital on Tulagi.[53] From there he returned to the United States in early January 1944. After receiving treatment for his back injury, he was released from active duty in late 1944.[54] Beginning in January 1945, Kennedy spent three more months recovering from his back injury at Castle Hot Springs, a resort and temporary military hospital in Arizona.[55][56]\",\n",
      "  \"Kennedy was in Chelsea Naval Hospital from May to December 1944.[32] On June 12, he was presented the Navy and Marine Corps Medal (the Navy's highest noncombat decoration for heroism) for his heroic actions on August 1\\u20132, 1943, and the Purple Heart Medal for his back injury on PT-109, on August 1, 1943 (injured on August 2).[57] After the war, Kennedy felt that the medal he had received for heroism was not a combat award and asked that he be reconsidered for the Silver Star Medal for which he had been recommended initially. (His father also requested the Silver Star, which is awarded for gallantry in action, for his son). In 1950, The Department of the Navy offered Kennedy a Bronze Star Medal in recognition of his meritorious service, but he would have to return his Navy and Marine Corps Medal in order to receive it. He declined the medal. In 1959, the Navy again offered him the Bronze Star. Kennedy responded, repeating his original request concerning the award. He received the same response from the Navy as he had in 1950. The Navy said his actions were a lifesaving case.[58] Kennedy's two original medals are currently on display at the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum.[59]\",\n",
      "  \"On August 12, 1944, Kennedy's older brother, Joe Jr., a Navy pilot, was killed while volunteering for a special and hazardous air mission. His explosive-laden plane blew up when the plane's bombs detonated prematurely while the aircraft was flying over the English Channel.[60]\",\n",
      "  \"On March 1, 1945, Kennedy retired from the Navy Reserve on physical disability and was honorably discharged with the full rank of lieutenant.[57] When later asked how he became a war hero, Kennedy joked: \\\"It was easy. They cut my PT boat in half.\\\"[61]\",\n",

      "  \"At the urging of Kennedy's father, U.S. Representative James Michael Curley vacated his seat in the strongly Democratic 11th congressional district in Massachusetts to become mayor of Boston in 1946. With his father financing and running his campaign, Kennedy won the Democratic primary with 12 percent of the vote, defeating ten other candidates. Though Republicans took control of the House in the 1946 elections, Kennedy defeated his Republican opponent in the general election, taking 73 percent of the vote. Along with Richard Nixon and Joseph McCarthy, Kennedy was one of several World War II veterans first elected to Congress that year.[66]\",\n",
      "  \"He served in the House for six years, joining the influential Education and Labor Committee and the Veterans' Affairs Committee. He concentrated his attention on international affairs, supporting the Truman Doctrine as the appropriate response to the emerging Cold War. He also supported public housing and opposed the Labor Management Relations Act of 1947, which restricted the power of labor unions. Though not as vocal an anticommunist as McCarthy, Congressman Kennedy supported the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, which required Communists to register with the government, and he deplored the \\\"Loss of China.\\\"[67] Having served as a Boy Scout during his childhood, Kennedy was active in the Boston Council from 1946 to 1955: as District Vice Chairman, member of the Executive Board, Vice-President, as well as a National Council Representative.[68][69]\",\n",
      "  \"As early as 1949, Kennedy began preparing to run for the Senate in 1952 against Republican three-term incumbent Henry Cabot Lodge Jr. Joseph Kennedy again financed and managed his son's candidacy, while John Kennedy's younger brother Robert Kennedy emerged as an important member of the campaign.[70] In the presidential election, General Dwight D. Eisenhower carried Massachusetts by a margin of 208,000 votes, but Kennedy defeated Lodge by 70,000 votes for the Senate seat.[71] The following year, he married Jacqueline Bouvier.[72]\",\n",
      "  \"Kennedy underwent several spinal operations over the next two years. Often absent from the Senate, he was at times critically ill and received Catholic last rites. During his convalescence in 1956, he published Profiles in Courage, a book about U.S. senators who risked their careers for their personal beliefs, for which he won the Pulitzer Prize for Biography in 1957.[73] Rumors that this work was co-written by his close adviser and speechwriter, Ted Sorensen, were confirmed in Sorensen's 2008 autobiography.[74]\",\n",

Kennedy finished second in the balloting, losing to Senator Estes Kefauver of Tennessee but receiving national exposure as a result.[76]\",\n",
      "  \"One of the matters demanding Kennedy's attention in the Senate was President Eisenhower's bill for the Civil Rights Act of 1957.[77] Kennedy cast a procedural vote on this, which was considered by some as an appeasement of Southern Democratic opponents of the bill.[77] Kennedy did vote for Title III of the act, which would have given the Attorney General powers to enjoin, but Majority Leader Lyndon B. Johnson agreed to let the provision die as a compromise measure.[78] Kennedy also voted for Title IV, termed the \\\"Jury Trial Amendment\\\". Many civil rights advocates at the time criticized that vote as one which would weaken the act.[79] A final compromise bill, which Kennedy supported, was passed in September 1957.[80]\",\n",
      "  \"In 1958, Kennedy was re-elected to a second term in the Senate, defeating his Republican opponent, Boston lawyer Vincent J. Celeste, by a wide margin of 874,608 votes; this represented the largest ever margin in Massachusetts politics.[71] It was during his re-election campaign that Kennedy's press secretary at the time, Robert E. Thompson, put together a film entitled The U.S. Senator John F. Kennedy Story, which exhibited a day in the life of the Senator and showcased his family life as well as the inner workings of his office. It was the most comprehensive film produced about Kennedy up to that time.[81] In the aftermath of his re-election, Kennedy began preparing to run for president in 1960.[82]\",\n",

As well, Bobby Kennedy worked for McCarthy's subcommittee, and McCarthy dated Kennedy sister Patricia. In 1954, the Senate voted to censure McCarthy and Kennedy drafted a speech supporting the censure. However, it was not delivered because Kennedy was hospitalized at the time. The speech had the potential of putting Kennedy in the position of participating procedurally by \\\"pairing\\\" his vote against that of another senator.

Though some questioned Kennedy's youth and experience, his charisma and eloquence earned him numerous supporters. His greatest obstacle to winning the nomination may have been his religion. Many Americans held anti-Catholic attitudes, but his vocal support of the separation of church and state helped to defuse the issue. His religion also helped him win a devoted following among many Catholic voters. Kennedy faced several potential challengers for the Democratic nomination, including Senate Majority Leader Lyndon B. Johnson, Adlai Stevenson, and Senator Hubert Humphrey. Kennedy traveled extensively to build his support among Democratic elites and voters. At the time, party officials controlled most of the delegates, but several states also held primaries, and Kennedy sought to win several primaries to boost his chances of winning the nomination. In his first major test, Kennedy won the Wisconsin primary, effectively ending Humphrey's hopes of winning the presidency. Nonetheless, Kennedy and Humphrey faced each other in a competitive West Virginia primary in which Kennedy could not benefit from a Catholic bloc, as he had in Wisconsin. Kennedy won the West Virginia primary, impressing many in the party, but at the start of the 1960 Democratic National Convention, it was unclear whether he would win the nomination.[84]\",\n",
      "  \"When Kennedy entered the convention, he had the most delegates, but not enough to ensure he would win the nomination. Stevenson\\u2014the 1952 and 1956 presidential nominee\\u2014remained very popular in the party, while Johnson also hoped to win the nomination with the support of party leaders. Kennedy's candidacy also faced opposition from former president Harry S. Truman, who worried about Kennedy's lack of experience. Kennedy knew that a second ballot could result in the nomination of Johnson or another candidate, and his well-organized campaign was able to earn the support of just enough delegates to win the presidential nomination on the first ballot.[85] Kennedy ignored the opposition of his brother, who wanted him to choose labor leader Walter Reuther,[86] and other liberal supporters when he chose Johnson as his vice presidential nominee. He believed that the Texas Senator could help him win support in the South.[87] In accepting the presidential nomination, Kennedy gave his well-known \\\"New Frontier\\\" speech, saying: \\\"For the problems are not all solved and the battles are not all won\\u2014and we stand today on the edge of a New Frontier.... But the New Frontier of which I speak is not a set of promises\\u2014it is a set of challenges. It sums up not what I intend to offer the American people, but what I intend to ask of them.\\\"[88]\",\n",
      "  \"At the start of the fall general election campaign, Republican nominee Richard Nixon, the incumbent vice president, held a six-point lead in the polls.[89] Major issues included how to get the economy moving again, Kennedy's Roman Catholicism, the Cuban Revolution, and whether the space and missile programs of the Soviet Union had surpassed those of the U.S. To address fears that his being Catholic would impact his decision-making, he famously told the Greater Houston Ministerial Association on September 12, 1960: \\\"I am not the Catholic candidate for president. I am the Democratic Party candidate for president who also happens to be a Catholic. I do not speak for my Church on public matters\\u00a0\\u2013 and the Church does not speak for me.\\\"[90] Kennedy questioned rhetorically whether one-quarter of Americans were relegated to second-class citizenship just because they were Catholic, and once stated that: \\\"No one asked me my religion [serving the Navy] in the South Pacific.\\\"[91]\",\n",
      "  \"In September and October, Kennedy squared off against Nixon in the first televised presidential debates in U.S. history. During these programs, Nixon had an injured leg, \\\"five o'clock shadow\\\", and was perspiring, making him look tense and uncomfortable. Conversely, Kennedy wore makeup and appeared relaxed, which helped the large television audience to view him as the winner. On average radio listeners thought that Nixon had won or that the debates were a draw.[92] The debates are now considered a milestone in American political history\\u2014the point at which the medium of television began to play a dominant role in politics.[73]\",\n",
      "  \"Kennedy's campaign gained momentum after the first debate, and he pulled slightly ahead of Nixon in most polls. On Election Day, Kennedy defeated Nixon in one of the closest presidential elections of the 20th century. In the national popular vote, by most accounts, Kennedy led Nixon by just two-tenths of one percent (49.7% to 49.5%), while in the Electoral College, he won 303 votes to Nixon's 219 (269 were needed to win).[93] Fourteen electors from Mississippi and Alabama refused to support Kennedy because of his support for the civil rights movement; they voted for Senator Harry F. Byrd of Virginia, as did an elector from Oklahoma.[93] Kennedy became the youngest person (43) ever elected to the presidency, though Theodore Roosevelt was a year younger at 42 when he automatically assumed the office after William McKinley's assassination in 1901.[94]\"\n",

In his inaugural address, he spoke of the need for all Americans to be active citizens, famously saying: \\\"Ask not what your country can do for you; ask what you can do for your country.\\\" He asked the nations of the world to join together to fight what he called the \\\"common enemies of man: tyranny, poverty, disease, and war itself.\\\"[95]\",\n",

Nor will it be finished in the first one thousand days, nor in the life of this Administration, nor even perhaps in our lifetime on this planet. But let us begin.\\\" In closing, he expanded on his desire for greater internationalism: \\\"Finally, whether you are citizens of America or citizens of the world, ask of us here the same high standards of strength and sacrifice which we ask of you.\\\"[95]\",\n",
      "  \"The address reflected Kennedy's confidence that his administration would chart a historically significant course in both domestic policy and foreign affairs. The contrast between this optimistic vision and the pressures of managing daily political realities at home and abroad would be one of the main tensions running through the early years of his administration.[96]\",\n",
      "  \"Kennedy brought to the White House a contrast in organization compared to the decision-making structure of former-General Eisenhower; and he wasted no time in scrapping Eisenhower's methods.[97] Kennedy preferred the organizational structure of a wheel with all the spokes leading to the president. He was ready and willing to make the increased number of quick decisions required in such an environment. He selected a mixture of experienced and inexperienced people to serve in his cabinet. \\\"We can learn our jobs together\\\", he stated.[98]\",\n",
      "  \"Much to the chagrin of his economic advisors who wanted him to reduce taxes, Kennedy quickly agreed to a balanced budget pledge. This was needed in exchange for votes to expand the membership of the House Rules Committee in order to give the Democrats a majority in setting the legislative agenda.[99] Kennedy focused on immediate and specific issues facing the administration, and quickly voiced his impatience with pondering of deeper meanings. Deputy National Security Advisor Walt Whitman Rostow once began a diatribe about the growth of communism, and Kennedy abruptly cut him off, asking, \\\"What do you want me to do about that today?\\\"[100]\",\n",

      "  \"President Kennedy's foreign policy was dominated by American confrontations with the Soviet Union, manifested by proxy contests in the early stage of the Cold War. In 1961, Kennedy anxiously anticipated a summit with Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev. He started off on the wrong foot by reacting aggressively to a routine Khrushchev speech on Cold War confrontation in early 1961. The speech was intended for domestic audiences in the Soviet Union, but Kennedy interpreted it as a personal challenge. His mistake helped raise tensions going into the Vienna Summit of June 1961.[104]\",\n",
      "  \"On the way to the summit, Kennedy stopped in Paris to meet Charles de Gaulle, who advised him to ignore Khrushchev's abrasive style. The French president feared the United States' presumed influence in Europe. Nevertheless, de Gaulle was quite impressed with the young president and his family. Kennedy picked up on this in his speech in Paris, saying that he would be remembered as \\\"the man who accompanied Jackie Kennedy to Paris.\\\"[105]\",\n",
      "  \"On June 4, 1961, the president met with Khrushchev in Vienna and left the meetings angry and disappointed that he had allowed the premier to bully him, despite the warnings he had received. Khrushchev, for his part, was impressed with the president's intelligence, but thought him weak. Kennedy did succeed in conveying the bottom line to Khrushchev on the most sensitive issue before them, a proposed treaty between Moscow and East Berlin. He made it clear that any such treaty which interfered with U.S access rights in West Berlin would be regarded as an act of war.[106]\",\n",
      "  \"Shortly after the president returned home, the U.S.S.R. announced its intention to sign a treaty with East Berlin, abrogating any third-party occupation rights in either sector of the city. Kennedy, depressed and angry, assumed that his only option was to prepare the country for nuclear war, which he personally thought had a one-in-five chance of occurring.[107]\",\n",
      "  \"In the weeks immediately after the Vienna summit, more than 20,000 people fled from East Berlin to the western sector in reaction to statements from the USSR. Kennedy began intensive meetings on the Berlin issue, where Dean Acheson took the lead in recommending a military buildup alongside NATO allies.[108] In a July 1961 speech, Kennedy announced his decision to add $3.25\\u00a0billion to the defense budget, along with over 200,000 additional troops, stating that an attack on West Berlin would be taken as an attack on the U.S. The speech received an 85% approval rating.[109]\",\n",
      "  \"The following month, the Soviet Union and East Berlin began blocking any further passage of East Berliners into West Berlin and erected barbed wire fences across the city, which were quickly upgraded to the Berlin Wall. Kennedy's initial reaction was to ignore this, as long as free access from West to East Berlin continued. This course was altered when it was learned that West Berliners had lost confidence in the defense of their position by the United States. Kennedy sent Vice President Johnson, along with a host of military personnel, in convoy through West Germany, including Soviet-armed checkpoints, to demonstrate the continued commitment of the U.S. to West Berlin.[110]\",\n",
      "  \"Kennedy gave a speech at Saint Anselm College on May 5, 1960, regarding America's conduct in the emerging Cold War.

      "  \"The prior Eisenhower administration had created a plan to overthrow Fidel Castro's regime in Cuba. The plan, led by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), with help from the U.S. military, was for an invasion of Cuba by a counter-revolutionary insurgency composed of U.S.-trained, anti-Castro Cuban exiles[112][113] led by CIA paramilitary officers. The intention was to invade Cuba and instigate an uprising among the Cuban people in hopes of removing Castro from power.[114] Kennedy approved the final invasion plan on April 4, 1961.\",\n",
      "  \"The Bay of Pigs Invasion began on April 17, 1961. Fifteen hundred U.S.-trained Cubans, called Brigade 2506, landed on the island. No U.S. air support was provided.

      "  \"By April 19, 1961, the Cuban government had captured or killed the invading exiles, and Kennedy was forced to negotiate for the release of the 1,189 survivors. After twenty months, Cuba released the captured exiles in exchange for $53\\u00a0million worth of food and medicine.[116] The incident made Castro wary of the U.S. and led him to believe that another invasion would occur.[117]\",\n",
      "  \"According to biographer Richard Reeves, Kennedy focused primarily on the political repercussions of the plan rather than military considerations. When it failed, he was convinced that the plan was a setup to make him look bad.[118] He took responsibility for the failure, saying: \\\"We got a big kick in the leg and we deserved it. But maybe we'll learn something from it.\\\"[119]\",\n",
      "  \"In late 1961, the White House formed the Special Group (Augmented), headed by Robert Kennedy and including Edward Lansdale, Secretary Robert McNamara, and others.

      "  \"On October 14, 1962, CIA U-2 spy planes took photographs of intermediate-range ballistic missile sites being built in Cuba by the Soviets. The photos were shown to Kennedy on October 16; a consensus was reached that the missiles were offensive in nature and thus posed an immediate nuclear threat.[121]\",\n",
      "  \"Kennedy faced a dilemma: if the U.S. attacked the sites, it might lead to nuclear war with the U.S.S.R., but if the U.S. did nothing, it would be faced with the increased threat from close-range nuclear weapons. The U.S. would also appear to the world as less committed to the defense of the hemisphere. On a personal level, Kennedy needed to show resolve in reaction to Khrushchev, especially after the Vienna summit.[122]\",\n",
      "  \"More than a third of the members of the National Security Council (NSC) favored an unannounced air assault on the missile sites, but for some of them this conjured up an image of \\\"Pearl Harbor in reverse\\\".[123] There was also some concern from the international community (asked in confidence), that the assault plan was an overreaction in light of the fact that PGM-19 Jupiter missiles had been placed in Italy and Turkey by Eisenhower in 1958. There could also be no assurance that the assault would be 100% effective.[124] In concurrence with a majority-vote of the NSC, Kennedy decided on a naval quarantine. On October 22 he dispatched a message to Khrushchev and announced the decision on TV.[125]\",\n",
      "  \"The U.S. Navy would stop and inspect all Soviet ships arriving off Cuba, beginning October 24. The Organization of American States gave unanimous support to the removal of the missiles. The president exchanged two sets of letters with Khrushchev, to no avail.[126] United Nations (UN) Secretary General U Thant requested that both parties reverse their decisions and enter a cooling-off period. Khrushchev agreed, Kennedy did not.[127]\",\n",
      "  \"One Soviet-flagged ship was stopped and boarded. On October 28 Khrushchev agreed to dismantle the missile sites, subject to UN inspections.[128] The U.S. publicly promised never to invade Cuba and privately agreed to remove its Jupiter missiles from Italy and Turkey, which were by then obsolete and had been supplanted by submarines equipped with UGM-27 Polaris missiles.[129]\",\n",
      "  \"This crisis brought the world closer to nuclear war than at any point before or since. In the end, \\\"the humanity\\\" of the two men prevailed.[130] The crisis improved the image of American willpower and the president's credibility. Kennedy's approval rating increased from 66% to 77% immediately thereafter.[131]\",\n",
      "  \"Arguing that \\\"those who make peaceful revolution impossible, will make violent revolution inevitable,\\\"[132] Kennedy sought to contain the perceived threat of communism in Latin America by establishing the Alliance for Progress, which sent aid to some countries and sought greater human rights standards in the region.[133] He worked closely with Governor of Puerto Rico Luis Mu\\u00f1oz Mar\\u00edn for the development of the Alliance of Progress, and began working towards the autonomy of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.\",\n",
      "  \"When the president took office, the Eisenhower administration, through the CIA, had begun formulating plans for the assassination of Castro in Cuba and Rafael Trujillo in the Dominican Republic. Kennedy privately instructed the CIA that any such planning must include plausible deniability by the U.S. His public position was in opposition.[134] In June 1961 the Dominican Republic's leader was assassinated; in the days following the event, Undersecretary of State Chester Bowles led a cautious reaction by the nation. Robert Kennedy, who saw an opportunity for the U.S., called Bowles \\\"a gutless bastard\\\" to his face.[135]\",\n",
      "  \"In one of his first presidential acts, Kennedy asked Congress to create the Peace Corps. His brother-in-law, Sargent Shriver, was its first director.[136] Through this program, Americans volunteered to help developing nations in areas such as education, farming, health care, and construction. The organization grew to 5,000 members by March 1963 and 10,000 the following year.[137] Since 1961, over 200,000 Americans have joined the Peace Corps, serving in 139 countries.[138][139]\",\n",
      "  \"When briefing Kennedy, Eisenhower emphasized that the communist threat in Southeast Asia required priority; Eisenhower considered Laos to be \\\"the cork in the bottle\\\" in regards to the regional threat. In March 1961, Kennedy voiced a change in policy from supporting a \\\"free\\\" Laos to a \\\"neutral\\\" Laos, indicating privately that Vietnam, and not Laos, should be deemed America's tripwire for communism's spread in the area.[140] In May, he dispatched Lyndon Johnson to meet with South Vietnam's President Ngo Dinh Diem. Johnson assured Diem more aid to mold a fighting force that could resist the communists.[141] Kennedy announced a change of policy from support to partnership with Diem to defeat of communism in South Vietnam.[142]\",\n",
      "  \"During his administration, Kennedy continued policies that provided political and economic support, and military advice and support, to the South Vietnamese government.[143] Late in 1961, the Viet Cong began assuming a predominant presence, initially seizing the provincial capital of Phuoc Vinh.[144] Kennedy increased the number of military advisors and special forces in the area, from 11,000 in 1962 to 16,000 by late 1963, but he was reluctant to order a full-scale deployment of troops.[145][146] A year and three months later on March 8, 1965, his successor, President Lyndon Johnson, committed the first combat troops to Vietnam and greatly escalated U.S. involvement, with forces reaching 184,000 that year and 536,000 in 1968.[147]\",\n",

There, Hilsman met Sir Robert Thompson, head of the British Advisory Mission to South Vietnam and the Strategic Hamlet Program was formed. It was approved by Kennedy and South Vietnam President Ngo Dinh Diem. It was implemented in early 1962 and involved some forced relocation, village internment, and segregation of rural South Vietnamese into new communities where the peasantry would be isolated from Communist insurgents. It was hoped that these new communities would provide security for the peasants and strengthen the tie between them and the central government. By November 1963 the program waned and officially ended in 1964.[148]\",\n",
      "  \"In early 1962, Kennedy formally authorized escalated involvement when he signed the National Security Action Memorandum\\u00a0\\u2013 \\\"Subversive Insurgency (War of Liberation)\\\".[149] \\\"Operation Ranch Hand\\\", a large-scale aerial defoliation effort, began on the roadsides of South Vietnam.[150] Depending on which assessment Kennedy accepted (Department of Defense or State) there had been zero or modest progress in countering the increase in communist aggression in return for an expanded U.S. involvement.[151]\",\n",
      "  \"In April 1963, Kennedy assessed the situation in Vietnam: \\\"We don't have a prayer of staying in Vietnam. Those people hate us.

      "  \"On August 21, just as the new U.S. Ambassador Henry Cabot Lodge, Jr. arrived, Diem and his brother Ngo Dinh Nhu ordered South Vietnam forces, funded and trained by the CIA, to quell Buddhist demonstrations. The crackdowns heightened expectations of a coup d'\\u00e9tat to remove Diem with (or perhaps by) his brother, Nhu.[153] Lodge was instructed to try to get Diem and Nhu to step down and leave the country. Diem would not listen to Lodge.[154] Cable 243 (DEPTEL 243), dated August 24, followed, declaring Washington would no longer tolerate Nhu's actions, and Lodge was ordered to pressure Diem to remove Nhu.[155] Lodge concluded that the only option was to get the South Vietnamese generals to overthrow Diem and Nhu.[156] At week's end, orders were sent to Saigon and throughout Washington to \\\"destroy all coup cables\\\".[157] At the same time, the first formal anti-Vietnam war sentiment was expressed by U.S. clergy from the Ministers' Vietnam Committee.[158]\",\n",
      "  \"A White House meeting in September was indicative of the different ongoing appraisals; the president was given updated assessments after personal inspections on the ground by the Department of Defense (General Victor Krulak) and the State Department (Joseph Mendenhall). Krulak said that the military fight against the communists was progressing and being won, while Mendenhall stated that the country was civilly being lost to any U.S. influence. Kennedy reacted, saying: \\\"Did you two gentlemen visit the same country?\\\" The president was unaware that the two men were at such odds that they had not spoken to each other on the return flight.[159]\",\n",
      "  \"In October 1963, the president appointed Defense Secretary McNamara and General Maxwell D. Taylor to a Vietnam mission in another effort to synchronize the information and formulation of policy. The objective of the McNamara Taylor mission \\\"emphasized the importance of getting to the bottom of the differences in reporting from U.S. representatives in Vietnam.\\\"[160] In meetings with McNamara, Taylor, and Lodge, Diem again refused to agree to governing measures, helping to dispel McNamara's previous optimism about Diem.[161] Taylor and McNamara were enlightened by Vietnam's vice president, Nguyen Ngoc Tho (choice of many to succeed Diem), who in detailed terms obliterated Taylor's information that the military was succeeding in the countryside.[162] At Kennedy's insistence, the mission report contained a recommended schedule for troop withdrawals: 1,000 by year's end and complete withdrawal in 1965, something the NSC considered a strategic fantasy.[163]\",\n",
      "  \"In late October, intelligence wires again reported that a coup against the Diem government was afoot. The source, Vietnamese General Duong Van Minh (also known as \\\"Big Minh\\\"), wanted to know the U.S. position. Kennedy instructed Lodge to offer covert assistance to the coup, excluding assassination.[164] On November 1, 1963, South Vietnamese generals, led by \\\"Big Minh\\\", overthrew the Diem government, arresting and then killing Diem and Nhu. Kennedy was shocked by the deaths.[165]\",\n",
      "  \"News of the coup led to renewed confidence initially\\u2014both in America and in South Vietnam\\u2014that the war might be won.[166] McGeorge Bundy drafted a National Security Action Memo to present to Kennedy upon his return from Dallas. It reiterated the resolve to fight communism in Vietnam, with increasing military and economic aid and expansion of operations into Laos and Cambodia. Before leaving for Dallas, Kennedy told Michael Forrestal that \\\"after the first of the year\\u00a0... [he wanted] an in depth study of every possible option, including how to get out of there\\u00a0... to review this whole thing from the bottom to the top.\\\" When asked what he thought the president meant, Forrestal said, \\\"it was devil's advocate stuff.\\\"[167]\",\n",
      "  \"Historians disagree on whether Vietnam would have escalated if Kennedy not been assassinated and had won re-election in 1964.[168] Fueling the debate were statements made by Secretary of Defense McNamara in the film \\\"The Fog of War\\\" that Kennedy was strongly considering pulling the United States out of Vietnam after the 1964 election.[169] The film also contains a tape recording of Lyndon Johnson stating that Kennedy was planning to withdraw, a position in which Johnson disagreed.[170] Kennedy had signed National Security Action Memorandum (NSAM) 263, dated October 11, which ordered the withdrawal of 1,000 military personnel by the end of the year, and the bulk of them out by 1965.[171][172] Such an action would have been a policy reversal, but Kennedy was moving in a less hawkish direction since his speech about world peace at American University on June 10, 1963.[173]\",\n",

I do not believe he knew in his last weeks what he was going to do.\\\"[175] Sorensen added that, in his opinion, Vietnam \\\"was the only foreign policy problem handed off by JFK to his successor in no better, and possibly worse, shape than it was when he inherited it.\\\"[175] U.S. involvement in the region escalated until his successor Lyndon Johnson directly deployed regular U.S. military forces for fighting the Vietnam War.[176][177] After Kennedy's assassination, President Johnson signed NSAM 273 on November 26, 1963.

But we have never had to put a wall up to keep our people in, to prevent them from leaving us.\\\" The speech is known for its famous phrase \\\"Ich bin ein Berliner\\\" (\\\"I am a citizen of Berlin\\\").

Kennedy ended the arms embargo that the Eisenhower and Truman administrations had enforced on Israel.

In 1962, the US and Israeli governments had agreed to an annual inspection regime.

The United Kingdom\\u2014which had just granted Kuwait independence on June 19, and whose economy was heavily dependent on Kuwaiti oil\\u2014responded on July 1 by dispatching 5,000 troops to the country to deter an Iraqi invasion. At the same time, Kennedy dispatched a U.S. Navy task force to Bahrain, and the UK (at the urging of the Kennedy administration) brought the dispute to United Nations Security Council, where the proposed resolution was vetoed by the Soviet Union.

U.S. officials were alarmed by the expropriation as well as the recent Soviet veto of an Egyptian-sponsored UN resolution requesting the admittance of Kuwait as UN member state, which they believed to be connected. Senior National Security Council adviser Robert Komer worried that if the IPC ceased production in response, Qasim might \\\"grab Kuwait\\\" (thus achieving a \\\"stranglehold\\\" on Middle Eastern oil production), or \\\"throw himself into Russian arms.\\\" Komer also made note of widespread rumors that a nationalist coup against Qasim could be imminent, and had the potential to \\\"get Iraq back on [a] more neutral keel.\\\"[203]\",\n",

The United States responded by conducting tests five days later.[213] Shortly thereafter, new U.S. satellites began delivering images which made it clear that the Soviets were substantially behind the U.S. in the arms race.[214] Nevertheless, the greater nuclear strength of the U.S. was of little value as long as the U.S.S.R. perceived itself to be at parity.[215]\",\n",

Board of Education that racial segregation in public schools was unconstitutional. Many schools, especially in southern states, did not obey the Supreme Court's decision. The Court also prohibited segregation at other public facilities (such as buses, restaurants, theaters, courtrooms, bathrooms, and beaches) but it continued nonetheless.[242]\",\n",

Robert Kennedy called Georgia governor Ernest Vandiver and obtained King's release from prison, which drew additional black support to his brother's candidacy.[242] Upon taking office in 1961, Kennedy postponed promised civil rights legislation he made while campaigning in 1960, recognizing that conservative Southern Democrats controlled congressional legislation.[243] Historian Carl M. Brauer concluded that passing any civil rights legislation in 1961 would have been futile.[243] During his first year in office Kennedy appointed many blacks to office including his May appointment of civil rights attorney Thurgood Marshall to the federal bench.

Kennedy assigned federal marshals to protect the Freedom Riders rather than using federal troops or uncooperative FBI agents.[244] Robert Kennedy, speaking for the president, urged the Freedom Riders to \\\"get off the buses and leave the matter to peaceful settlement in the courts.\\\"[247] Kennedy feared sending federal troops would stir up \\\"hated memories of Reconstruction\\\" after the Civil War among conservative Southern whites.[244]\",\n",

Displeased with Kennedy's pace addressing the issue of segregation, Martin Luther King, Jr. and his associates produced a document in 1962 calling on the president to follow in the footsteps of Abraham Lincoln and use an Executive Order to deliver a blow for Civil Rights as a kind of Second Emancipation Proclamation.

Kennedy regretted not sending in troops earlier and he began to doubt whether the \\\"evils of Reconstruction\\\" of the 1860s and 1870s he had been taught or believed in were true.[244] The instigating subculture at the Old Miss riot, and at many other racially ignited events, was the Ku Klux Klan.[251] On November 20, 1962, Kennedy signed Executive Order 11063, prohibiting racial discrimination in federally supported housing or \\\"related facilities\\\".[252]\",\n",

Kennedy feared the March would have a negative effect on the prospects for the civil rights bills in Congress, and declined an invitation to speak. He turned over some of the details of the government's involvement to the Dept. of Justice, which channelled hundreds of thousands of dollars to the six sponsors of the March, including the N.A.A.C.P. and Martin Luther King's Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC).[266]\",\n",
      "  \"To ensure a peaceful demonstration, the organizers and the president personally edited speeches which were inflammatory and agreed the March would be held on a Wednesday and would be over at 4:00\\u00a0pm. Thousands of troops were placed on standby. Kennedy watched King's speech on TV and was very impressed. The March was considered a \\\"triumph of managed protest\\\", and not one arrest relating to the demonstration occurred. Afterwards, the March leaders accepted an invitation to the White House to meet with Kennedy and photos were taken. Kennedy felt that the March was a victory for him as well and bolstered the chances for his civil rights bill.[266]\",\n",

Three weeks later, a bomb exploded on Sunday, September 15, at the 16th Street Baptist Church in Birmingham; by the end of the day, four African American children had died in the explosion, and two other children were shot to death in the aftermath.[267] Due to this resurgent violence, the civil rights legislation underwent some drastic amendments that critically endangered any prospects for passage of the bill, to the outrage of the president. Kennedy called the congressional leaders to the White House and by the following day the original bill, without the additions, had enough votes to get it out of the House committee.[268] Gaining Republican support, Senator Everett Dirksen promised the legislation would be brought to a vote preventing a Senate filibuster.[269] The legislation was enacted by Kennedy's successor President Lyndon B.

Concerned by these allegations, the FBI deployed agents to monitor King in the following months.[270] Robert Kennedy and the president also both warned King to discontinue the suspect associations. After the associations continued, Robert Kennedy issued a written directive authorizing the FBI to wiretap King and other leaders of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, King's civil rights organization, in October 1963.[270]\",\n",

Kennedy was asked by the American Civil Liberties Union to intervene and to halt the project, but he declined, citing a critical need for flood control.

Over a period of three years (1964\\u20131966), an estimated 16\\u00a0million people visited his grave. On March 14, 1967, Kennedy's remains were disinterred and moved only a few feet away to a permanent burial plot and memorial. It was from this memorial that the graves of both Robert and Ted Kennedy were modeled.\",\n",

      "  \"The Kennedy family is one of the most established political families in the United States, having produced a president, three senators, an ambassador, and multiple other representatives, both at the federal and state level. While a Congressman, Kennedy embarked on a seven-week trip to India, Japan, Vietnam, and Israel in 1951, at which point he became close with his then 25-year-old brother Bobby, as well as his 27-year-old sister Pat. Because they were several years apart in age, the brothers had previously seen little of each other. This 25,000-mile (40,000\\u00a0km) trip was the first extended time they had spent together and resulted in their becoming best friends.[314] Robert would play a major role in his brother's career, and he served as his brother's Attorney General and presidential advisor.[314] Robert would later run for president in 1968 before his assassination, while another Kennedy brother, Ted, ran for president in 1980.\",\n",

      "  \"Kennedy met his future wife, Jacqueline Lee \\\"Jackie\\\" Bouvier (1929\\u20131994), when he was a congressman. Charles L. Bartlett, a journalist, introduced the pair at a dinner party.[319] They were married a year after he was elected senator, on September 12, 1953.[320] Their second child Caroline was born in 1957 and is the only surviving member of JFK's immediate family. John Fitzgerald Kennedy Jr., nicknamed \\\"John-John\\\" by the press as a child, was born in late November 1960, 17 days after his father was elected. John Jr., a graduate of Brown University, died in 1999 when the small plane he was piloting crashed en route to Martha's Vineyard.[321]\",\n",
      "  \"Kennedy and his wife were younger in comparison to the presidents and first ladies who preceded them, and both were popular in the media culture in ways more common to pop singers and movie stars than politicians, influencing fashion trends and becoming the subjects of numerous photo spreads in popular magazines. Although Eisenhower had allowed presidential press conferences to be filmed for television, Kennedy was the first president to ask for them to be broadcast live and made good use of the medium.[322] In 1961 the Radio-Television News Directors Association presented Kennedy with its highest honor, the Paul White Award, in recognition of his open relationship with the media.[323]\",\n",
      "  \"Mrs. Kennedy brought new art and furniture to the White House, and directed its restoration. They invited a range of artists, writers and intellectuals to rounds of White House dinners, raising the profile of the arts in America. On the White House lawn, the Kennedys established a swimming pool and tree house, while Caroline attended a preschool along with 10 other children inside the home.\",\n",
      "  \"The president was closely tied to popular culture, emphasized by songs such as \\\"Twisting at the White House\\\". Vaughn Meader's First Family comedy album, which parodied the president, the first lady, their family, and the administration, sold about four million copies. On May 19, 1962, Marilyn Monroe sang \\\"Happy Birthday, Mr. President\\\" at a large party in Madison Square Garden, celebrating Kennedy's upcoming forty-fifth birthday.\",\n",
      "  \"The term \\\"Camelot\\\" came to be used retrospectively as iconic of the Kennedy administration, and the charisma of Kennedy and his family. The term was first publicly used by his wife in a post-assassination Life magazine interview with Theodore H. White, in which she revealed his affection for the contemporary Broadway musical of the same name, particularly the closing lines of the title song:[324]\",\n",
      "  \"Don't let it be forgot, that once there was a spot, for one brief, shining moment that was known as Camelot.\\nThere'll be great presidents again ... but there will never be another Camelot.\",\n",
      "  \"In 2002 Robert Dallek wrote an extensive history of Kennedy's health. Dallek was able to consult a collection of Kennedy-associated papers from the years 1955\\u20131963, including X-rays and prescription records from the files of White House physician Dr. Janet Travell. According to Travell's records, during his presidential years Kennedy suffered from high fevers; stomach, colon, and prostate issues; abscesses; high cholesterol; and adrenal problems. Travell kept a \\\"Medicine Administration Record,\\\" cataloguing Kennedy's medications: \\\"injected and ingested corticosteroids for his adrenal insufficiency; procaine shots and ultrasound treatments and hot packs for his back; Lomotil, Metamucil, paregoric, phenobarbital, testosterone, and trasentine to control his diarrhea, abdominal discomfort, and weight loss; penicillin and other antibiotics for his urinary-tract infections and an abscess; and Tuinal to help him sleep.\\\"[14]\",\n",
      "  \"Years after Kennedy's death, it was revealed that in September 1947, while Kennedy was 30 and in his first term in Congress, he was diagnosed by Sir Daniel Davis at The London Clinic with Addison's disease, a rare endocrine disorder. In 1966 Dr. Travell revealed that Kennedy also had hypothyroidism. The presence of two endocrine diseases raises the possibility that Kennedy had autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome type 2 (APS 2).[326]\",\n",
      "  \"Kennedy also suffered from chronic and severe back pain, for which he had surgery and was written up in the American Medical Association's Archives of Surgery. Kennedy's condition may have had diplomatic repercussions, as he appears to have been taking a combination of drugs to treat severe back pain during the 1961 Vienna Summit with Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev. The combination included hormones, animal organ cells, steroids, vitamins, enzymes, and amphetamines, and possible potential side effects included hyperactivity, hypertension, impaired judgment, nervousness, and mood swings.[327] Kennedy at one time was regularly seen by no fewer than three doctors, one of whom, Max Jacobson, was unknown to the other two, as his mode of treatment was controversial[328] and used for the most severe bouts of back pain.[329]\",\n",
      "  \"Into late 1961, there were disagreements among Kennedy's doctors concerning his proper balance of medication and exercise. The president preferred the former, because he was short on time and desired immediate relief.[215] During that time frame, the president's physician, George Burkley, did set up some gym equipment in the White House basement, where Kennedy did stretching exercises for his back three times a week.[330] Details of these and other medical problems were not publicly disclosed during Kennedy's lifetime.[331] The President's primary White House physician, George Burkley, realized that treatments by Jacobson and Travell, including the excessive use of steroids and amphetamines, were medically inappropriate, and took effective action to remove the president from their care.[332] It was later observed that President Kennedy's leadership (e.g. the 1962 Cuban Missile crisis and other events during 1963) improved greatly once the treatments of Jacobson had been discontinued and been replaced by a medically appropriate regimen under Burkley. Dr. Ghaemi, who studied Kennedy's medical records, concluded there was a \\\"correlation; it is not causation; but it may not be coincidence either\\\".[332]\",\n",
      "  \"Kennedy experienced a number of family tragedies. His older brother Joseph P. Kennedy Jr. was killed in action in 1944 at age 29, when his plane exploded over the English Channel during a first attack execution of Operation Aphrodite during World War II.[333] Kennedy's younger sister Rose Marie \\\"Rosemary\\\" Kennedy was born in 1918 with intellectual disabilities and underwent a prefrontal lobotomy at age 23, leaving her permanently incapacitated. His younger sister Kathleen Agnes \\\"Kick\\\" Kennedy died in France as the result of a plane crash in 1948. His wife Jacqueline Kennedy suffered a miscarriage in 1955 and a stillbirth in 1956: a daughter informally named Arabella.[334] A son, Patrick Bouvier Kennedy, died two days after birth in August 1963.\",\n",
      "  \"Kennedy was single in the 1940s when he had affairs with Danish journalist Inga Arvad[335] and actress Gene Tierney.[336] Before and after he assumed the presidency, Kennedy reportedly had extramarital affairs with a number of women, including Marilyn Monroe,[337] Gunilla von Post,[338] Judith Campbell,[339] Mary Pinchot Meyer,[340] Marlene Dietrich,[341] Mimi Alford,[342] and his wife's press secretary, Pamela Turnure.[343]\",\n",

Edgar Hoover, the FBI director, received reports about Kennedy's indiscretions.[346]\",\n",
      "  \"Kennedy inspired affection and loyalty from the members of his team and his supporters.[347] According to Reeves, this included \\\"the logistics of Kennedy's liaisons.....[which] required secrecy and devotion rare in the annals of the energetic service demanded by successful politicians.\\\"[348] Kennedy believed that his friendly relationship with members of the press would help protect him from public revelations about his sex life.[349]\"\n",

      " \"Historical evaluations and legacy\": [\n",
      "  \"The US Special Forces had a special bond with Kennedy. \\\"It was President Kennedy who was responsible for the rebuilding of the Special Forces and giving us back our Green Beret,\\\" said Forrest Lindley, a writer for the US military newspaper Stars and Stripes who served with Special Forces in Vietnam.[a] This bond was shown at Kennedy's funeral. At the commemoration of the 25th anniversary of Kennedy's death, General Michael D. Healy, the last commander of Special Forces in Vietnam, spoke at Arlington Cemetery. Later, a wreath in the form of the Green Beret would be placed on the grave, continuing a tradition that began the day of his funeral when a sergeant in charge of a detail of Special Forces men guarding the grave placed his beret on the coffin.[350] Kennedy was the first of six presidents to have served in the U.S. Navy,[351] and one of the enduring legacies of his administration was the creation in 1961 of another special forces command, the Navy SEALs,[352] which Kennedy enthusiastically supported.[353]\",\n",
      "  \"Kennedy's civil rights proposals led to the Civil Rights Act of 1964.[354] President Lyndon B. Johnson, Kennedy's successor, took up the mantle and pushed the landmark Civil Rights Act through a bitterly divided Congress by invoking the slain president's memory.[355][356] President Johnson then signed the Act into law on July 2, 1964. This civil rights law ended what was known as the \\\"Solid South\\\" and certain provisions were modeled after the Civil Rights Act of 1875, signed into law by President Ulysses S. Grant.[357]\",\n",
      "  \"Kennedy's continuation of Presidents Harry S. Truman and Dwight D. Eisenhower's policies of giving economic and military aid to South Vietnam left the door open for President Johnson's escalation of the conflict.[358] At the time of Kennedy's death, no final policy decision had been made as to Vietnam, leading historians, cabinet members, and writers to continue to disagree on whether the Vietnam conflict would have escalated to the point it did had he survived.[359][174] His agreement to the NSAM 263[171] action of withdrawing 1,000 troops by the end of 1963, and his earlier 1963 speech at American University,[173] suggest that he was ready to end the Vietnam War. The Vietnam War contributed greatly to a decade of national difficulties, amid violent disappointment on the political landscape.\",\n",
      "  \"Many of Kennedy's speeches (especially his inaugural address) are considered iconic; and despite his relatively short term in office, and the lack of major legislative changes coming to fruition during his term, Americans regularly vote him as one of the best presidents, in the same league as Abraham Lincoln, George Washington, and Franklin D. Roosevelt. Some excerpts of Kennedy's inaugural address are engraved on a plaque at his grave at Arlington. In 2018, The Times published an audio recreation of the \\\"watchmen on the walls of world freedom\\\" speech he was scheduled to deliver at the Dallas Trade Mart on November 22, 1963.[360][361]\",\n",
      "  \"He was posthumously awarded the Pacem in Terris Award (Latin: Peace on Earth). It was named after a 1963 encyclical letter by Pope John XXIII that calls upon all people of goodwill to secure peace among all nations.\",\n",
      "  \"Kennedy is the only president to have predeceased both his mother and father. He is also the only president to have predeceased a grandparent. His maternal grandmother, Mary Josephine \\\"Josie\\\" Hannon, died in August 1964, nine months after his assassination.\",\n",
      "  \"Throughout the English-speaking world, the given name Kennedy has sometimes been used in honor of President Kennedy, as well his brother Robert.[362]\",\n",
      "  \"Television became the primary source by which people were kept informed of events surrounding John F. Kennedy's assassination. In fact, television started to come of age before the assassination. On September 2, 1963, Kennedy helped inaugurate network television's first half-hour nightly evening newscast according to an interview with CBS Evening News anchor Walter Cronkite.[363]\",\n",
      "  \"Newspapers were kept as souvenirs rather than sources of updated information.[citation needed] In this sense his assassination was the first major TV news event of its kind. TV coverage united the nation, interpreting what went on, and creating memories of this space in time.[citation needed] All three major U.S. television networks suspended their regular schedules and switched to all-news coverage from November 22 through November 26, 1963, being on the air for 70 hours, making it the longest uninterrupted news event on American TV until 9/11.[364]\",\n",
      "  \"The assassination had an effect on many people, not only in the U.S. but around the world. Many vividly remember where they were when they first learned the news that Kennedy was assassinated, as with the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, before it and the September 11 attacks after it. UN Ambassador Adlai Stevenson said of the assassination: \\\"all of us..... will bear the grief of his death until the day of ours.\\\" Many people have also spoken of the shocking news, compounded by the pall of uncertainty about the identity of the assassin(s), the possible instigators, and the causes of the killing, as an end to innocence, and in retrospect it has been coalesced with other changes of the tumultuous decade of the 1960s, especially the Vietnam War.\",\n",
      "  \"Ultimately, the death of President Kennedy, and the ensuing confusion surrounding the facts of his assassination, are of political and historical importance insofar as they marked a turning point and decline in the faith of the American people in the political establishment\\u2014a point made by commentators from Gore Vidal to Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr. and implied by Oliver Stone in several of his films, such as his landmark 1991 JFK.[citation needed]\",\n",

He had previously served as the 36th Vice President of the United States from 1953 to 1961, and prior to that as a U.S. Representative and also Senator from California.\",\n",
      "  \"Nixon was born in Yorba Linda, California. After completing his undergraduate studies at Whittier College, he graduated from Duke University School of Law in 1937 and returned to California to practice law. He and his wife Pat moved to Washington in 1942 to work for the federal government. He subsequently served on active duty in the U.S. Navy Reserve during World War II. Nixon was elected to the House of Representatives in 1946 and to the Senate in 1950. His pursuit of the Hiss Case established his reputation as a leading anti-communist and elevated him to national prominence. He was the running mate of Dwight D. Eisenhower, the Republican Party presidential nominee in the 1952 election. Nixon served for eight years as Vice President, becoming the second-youngest vice president in history at age 40. He waged an unsuccessful presidential campaign in 1960, narrowly losing to John F. Kennedy, and lost a race for Governor of California to Pat Brown in 1962. In 1968, he ran for the presidency again and was elected, defeating incumbent Vice President Hubert Humphrey.\",\n",
      "  \"Nixon ended American involvement in the war in Vietnam in 1973 and brought the American POWs home, and ended the military draft. Nixon's visit to China in 1972 eventually led to diplomatic relations between the two nations and he initiated d\\u00e9tente and the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty with the Soviet Union the same year. His administration generally transferred power from Washington D.C. to the states. He imposed wage and price controls for ninety days, enforced desegregation of Southern schools, established the Environmental Protection Agency and began the War on Cancer. Nixon also presided over the Apollo 11 moon landing, which signaled the end of the moon race. He was reelected in one of the largest electoral landslides in U.S. history in 1972 when he defeated George McGovern.\",\n",
      "  \"In his second term, Nixon ordered an airlift to resupply Israeli losses in the Yom Kippur War, resulting in the restart of the Middle East peace process and an oil crisis at home. The Nixon administration supported a coup in Chile that ousted the government of Salvador Allende and propelled Augusto Pinochet to power. By late 1973, the Watergate scandal escalated, costing Nixon much of his political support. On August 9, 1974, he resigned in the face of almost certain impeachment and removal from office. After his resignation, he was issued a controversial pardon by his successor, Gerald Ford. In 20 years of retirement, Nixon wrote nine books and undertook many foreign trips, helping to rehabilitate his image into that of elder statesman. He suffered a debilitating stroke on April 18, 1994 and died four days later at the age of 81.\"\n",

      " \"Early life\": [\n",
      "  \"Richard Milhous Nixon was born on January 9, 1913 in Yorba Linda, California, in a house that was built by his father.[2][3] His parents were Hannah (Milhous) Nixon and Francis A. Nixon. His mother was a Quaker, and his father converted from Methodism to the Quaker faith. Nixon was a descendant of the early American settler, Thomas Cornell, who was also an ancestor of Ezra Cornell, the founder of Cornell University, as well as of Jimmy Carter and Bill Gates.[4]\",\n",
      "  \"Nixon's upbringing was marked by evangelical Quaker observances of the time, such as refraining from alcohol, dancing, and swearing. Nixon had four brothers: Harold (1909\\u201333), Donald (1914\\u201387), Arthur (1918\\u201325), and Edward (born 1930).[5] Four of the five Nixon boys were named after kings who had ruled in historical or legendary Britain; Richard, for example, was named after Richard the Lionheart.[6][7]\",\n",
      "  \"Nixon's early life was marked by financial hardship, but he would have a happy childhood. He later quoted a saying of Eisenhower to describe his boyhood: \\\"We were poor, but the glory of it was we didn't know it\\\".[8] The Nixon family ranch failed in 1922, and the family moved to Whittier, California. In an area with many Quakers, Frank Nixon opened a grocery store and gas station.[9] Richard's younger brother Arthur died in 1925 at the age of seven after a short illness.[10] At the age of twelve, a spot was found on Richard's lung, and, with a family history of tuberculosis, he was forbidden to play sports. Eventually, the spot was found to be scar tissue from an early bout of pneumonia.[11][12]\",\n",
      "  \"Young Richard attended East Whittier Elementary School, where he was president of his eighth-grade class.[13] His parents believed that attending Whittier High School had caused Richard's older brother Harold to live a dissolute lifestyle before he fell ill of tuberculosis (he died of the disease in 1933), so they sent Richard to the larger Fullerton Union High School.[14][15] He had to ride a school bus for an hour each way during his freshman year, and he received excellent grades. Later, he lived with an aunt in Fullerton during the week.[16] He played junior varsity football, and seldom missed a practice, even though he was rarely used in games.[17] He had greater success as a debater, winning a number of championships and taking his only formal tutelage in public speaking from Fullerton's Head of English, H. Lynn Sheller. Nixon later remembered Sheller's words, \\\"Remember, speaking is conversation\\u00a0... don't shout at people. Talk to them. Converse with them.\\\"[18] Nixon stated that he tried to use the conversational tone as much as possible.[18]\",\n",
      "  \"At the start of his junior year beginning in September 1928, Richard's parents permitted him to transfer to Whittier High School. At Whittier High, Nixon suffered his first electoral defeat, for student body president. He often rose at 4\\u00a0a.m., to drive the family truck into Los Angeles and purchase vegetables at the market. He then drove to the store to wash and display them, before going to school. Harold had been diagnosed with tuberculosis the previous year; when their mother took him to Arizona in the hopes of improving his health, the demands on Richard increased, causing him to give up football. Nevertheless, Richard graduated from Whittier High third in his class of 207\\u00a0students.[19]\",\n",
      "  \"Nixon was offered a tuition grant to attend Harvard University, but Harold's continued illness and the need for their mother to care for him meant Richard was needed at the store. He remained in his hometown and attended Whittier College, his expenses there covered by a bequest from his maternal grandfather.[20] Nixon played for the basketball team; he also tried out for football but lacked the size to play. He remained on the team as a substitute and was noted for his enthusiasm.[21] Instead of fraternities and sororities, Whittier had literary societies. Nixon was snubbed by the only one for men, the Franklins; many members of the Franklins were from prominent families, but Nixon was not. He responded by helping to found a new society, the Orthogonian Society.[22] In addition to the society, schoolwork, and work at the store, Nixon found time for a large number of extracurricular activities, becoming a champion debater and gaining a reputation as a hard worker.[23] In 1933, he became engaged to Ola Florence Welch, daughter of the Whittier police chief. The two broke up in 1935.[24]\",\n",
      "  \"After his graduation from Whittier in 1934, Nixon received a full scholarship to attend Duke University School of Law.[25] The school was new and sought to attract top students by offering scholarships.[26] It paid high salaries to its professors, many of whom had national or international reputations.[27] The number of scholarships was greatly reduced for second- and third-year students, forcing recipients into intense competition.[26] Nixon not only kept his scholarship but was elected president of the Duke Bar Association,[28] inducted into the Order of the Coif,[29] and graduated third in his class in June 1937.[25]\"\n",

      "  \"After graduating from Duke, Nixon initially hoped to join the Federal Bureau of Investigation. He received no response to his letter of application and learned years later that he had been hired, but his appointment had been canceled at the last minute due to budget cuts.[30] Instead, he returned to California and was admitted to the bar in 1937. He began practicing in Whittier with the law firm Wingert and Bewley,[25] working on commercial litigation for local petroleum companies and other corporate matters, as well as on wills.[31] In later years, Nixon proudly stated that he was the only modern president to have previously worked as a practicing attorney. Nixon was reluctant to work on divorce cases, disliking frank sexual talk from women.[32] In 1938, he opened up his own branch of Wingert and Bewley in La Habra, California,[33] and became a full partner in the firm the following year.[34]\",\n",
      "  \"In January 1938, Nixon was cast in the Whittier Community Players production of The Dark Tower. There he played opposite a high school teacher named Thelma \\\"Pat\\\" Ryan.[25] Nixon described it in his memoirs as \\\"a case of love at first sight\\\"[35]\\u2014for Nixon only, as Pat Ryan turned down the young lawyer several times before agreeing to date him.[36] Once they began their courtship, Ryan was reluctant to marry Nixon; they dated for two years before she assented to his proposal. They wed in a small ceremony on June 21, 1940. After a honeymoon in Mexico, the Nixons began their married life in Whittier.[37] They had two daughters, Tricia (born 1946) and Julie (born 1948).[38]\"\n",

Both Nixon and his wife believed he was limiting his prospects by remaining in Whittier.[39] He was assigned to the tire rationing division, where he was tasked with replying to correspondence. He did not enjoy the role, and four months later, applied to join the United States Navy.[40] As a birthright Quaker, he could have claimed exemption from the draft; he might also have been deferred because he worked in government service. But instead of exploiting his circumstance, Nixon sought a commission in the navy. His application was successful, and he was appointed a lieutenant junior grade in the U.S Naval Reserve (U.S. Navy Reserve) on June 15, 1942.[41][42]\",\n",
      "  \"In October 1942, he was assigned as aide to the commander of the Naval Air Station Ottumwa in Iowa until May 1943.[41] On October 1, 1943, Nixon was promoted to lieutenant.[41] Seeking more excitement, he requested sea duty and was reassigned as the naval passenger control officer for the South Pacific Combat Air Transport Command, supporting the logistics of operations in the South West Pacific theater;[43][44] he was the Officer in Charge of the Combat Air Transport Command at Guadalcanal in the Solomons and in March 1944 at Green Island (Nissan Island) just north of Bougainville.[41] His unit prepared manifests and flight plans for C-47 operations and supervised the loading and unloading of the cargo aircraft. For this service, he received a Navy Letter of Commendation (awarded a Navy Commendation Ribbon which was later updated to the Navy and Marine Corps Commendation Medal) from his commanding officer for \\\"meritorious and efficient performance of duty as Officer in Charge of the South Pacific Combat Air Transport Command\\\". Upon his return to the U.S., Nixon was appointed the administrative officer of the Alameda Naval Air Station in California. In January 1945, he was transferred to the Bureau of Aeronautics office in Philadelphia to help negotiate the termination of war contracts, and received his second letter of commendation, from the Secretary of the Navy [45] for \\\"meritorious service, tireless effort, and devotion to duty\\\". Later, Nixon was transferred to other offices to work on contracts and finally to Baltimore.[46] On October 3, 1945, he was promoted to lieutenant commander.[41][45] On March 10, 1946, he was relieved of active duty.[41] He resigned his commission on New Year's Day 1946.[47] On June 1, 1953, he was promoted to commander.[41] He retired in the U.S. Naval Reserve on June 6, 1966.[41]\"\n",

They formed a \\\"Committee of 100\\\" to decide on a candidate, hoping to avoid internal dissensions which had led to Voorhis victories. After the committee failed to attract higher-profile candidates, Herman Perry, Whittier's Bank of America branch manager, suggested Nixon, a family friend with whom he had served on the Whittier College Board of Trustees before the war. Perry wrote to Nixon in Baltimore. After a night of excited talk between the Nixons, the naval officer responded to Perry with enthusiasm. Nixon flew to California and was selected by the committee. When he left the Navy at the start of 1946, Nixon and his wife returned to Whittier, where Nixon began a year of intensive campaigning.[48][49] He contended that Voorhis had been ineffective as a congressman and suggested that Voorhis's endorsement by a group linked to communists meant that Voorhis must have radical views.[50] Nixon won the election, receiving 65,586 votes to Voorhis' 49,994.[51]\",\n",

He was part of the Herter Committee, which went to Europe to report on the need for U.S. foreign aid. Nixon was the youngest member of the committee and the only Westerner.[52] Advocacy by Herter Committee members, including Nixon, led to congressional passage of the Marshall Plan.[53]\",\n",
      "  \"In his memoirs, Nixon recounts that he joined the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) \\\"at the end of 1947.\\\" However, he was already a HUAC member in early February 1947, when he heard \\\"Enemy Number One\\\" Gerhard Eisler and his sister Ruth Fischer testify. On February 18, 1947, Nixon referred to Eisler's belligerence toward HUAC in his maiden speech to the House. Also by early February 1947, fellow U.S. Representative Charles J. Kersten had introduced him to Father John Francis Cronin in Baltimore, who shared with Nixon his 1945 privately circulated paper \\\"The Problem of American Communism in 1945,\\\" [54] with much information from the FBI's William C.

On May 19, 1948, the bill passed the House by 319 to 58 but failed to pass the Senate.[56] (The Nixon Library cites this bill's passage as Nixon's first significant victory in Congress.[57])\",\n",
      "  \"Nixon first gained national attention in August 1948 when as a HUAC member, his persistence helped break the Alger Hiss spy case. While many doubted Whittaker Chambers' allegations that Hiss, a former State Department official, had been a Soviet spy, Nixon believed them to be true and pressed for the committee to continue its investigation. Under suit for defamation filed by Hiss, Chambers produced documents corroborating his allegations. These included paper and microfilm copies that Chambers turned over to House investigators after having hidden them overnight in a field; they became known as the \\\"Pumpkin Papers\\\".[58] Hiss was convicted of perjury in 1950 for denying under oath he had passed documents to Chambers.[59] In 1948, Nixon successfully cross-filed as a candidate in his district, winning both major party primaries,[60] and was comfortably reelected.[61]\",\n",

As part of that effort, a \\\"Pink Sheet\\\" was distributed by the Nixon campaign suggesting that, as Douglas' voting record was similar to that of New York Congressman Vito Marcantonio (believed by some to be a communist), their political views must be nearly identical.[67] Nixon won the election by almost twenty percentage points.[68] During this campaign, Nixon was first called \\\"Tricky Dick\\\" by his opponents for his campaign tactics.[69]\",\n",

Truman's handling of the Korean War.[70] He supported statehood for Alaska and Hawaii, voted in favor of civil rights for minorities, and supported federal disaster relief for India and Yugoslavia.[72] He voted against price controls and other monetary restrictions, benefits for illegal immigrants, and public power.[72]\",\n",

He had no strong preference for a vice presidential candidate, and Republican officeholders and party officials met in a \\\"smoke-filled room\\\" and recommended Nixon to the general, who agreed to the senator's selection. Nixon's youth (he was then 39), stance against communism, and political base in California\\u2014one of the largest states\\u2014were all seen as vote-winners by the leaders. Among the candidates considered along with Nixon were Ohio Senator Robert A. Taft, New Jersey Governor Alfred Driscoll and Illinois Senator Everett Dirksen.[73][74] On the campaign trail, Eisenhower spoke to his plans for the country, leaving the negative campaigning to his running mate.[75]\",\n",
      "  \"In mid-September, the Republican ticket faced a major crisis.[76] The media reported that Nixon had a political fund, maintained by his backers, which reimbursed him for political expenses.[77] Such a fund was not illegal, but it exposed Nixon to allegations of possible conflict of interest. With pressure building for Eisenhower to demand Nixon's resignation from the ticket, the senator went on television to deliver an address to the nation on September 23, 1952.[78] The address, later termed the Checkers speech, was heard by about 60 million Americans\\u2014including the largest television audience up to that point.[79] Nixon emotionally defended himself, stating that the fund was not secret, nor had donors received special favors. He painted himself as a man of modest means (his wife had no mink coat; instead she wore a \\\"respectable Republican cloth coat\\\") and a patriot.[78] The speech would be remembered for the gift which Nixon had received, but which he would not give back: \\\"a little cocker spaniel dog \\u2026 sent all the way from Texas. And our little girl\\u2014Tricia, the 6-year-old\\u2014named it Checkers.\\\"[78] The speech prompted a huge public outpouring of support for Nixon.[80] Eisenhower decided to retain him on the ticket,[81] which proved victorious in the November election.[75]\",\n",

A 1953 tour of the Far East succeeded in increasing local goodwill toward the United States and prompted Nixon to appreciate the potential of the region as an industrial center. He visited Saigon and Hanoi in French Indochina.[83] On his return to the United States at the end of 1953, Nixon increased the amount of time he devoted to foreign relations.[84]\",\n",

      "  \"Despite intense campaigning by Nixon, who reprised his strong attacks on the Democrats, the Republicans lost control of both houses of Congress in the 1954 elections. These losses caused Nixon to contemplate leaving politics once he had served out his term.[86] On September 24, 1955, President Eisenhower suffered a heart attack; his condition was initially believed to be life-threatening. Eisenhower was unable to perform his duties for six weeks. The 25th Amendment to the United States Constitution had not yet been proposed, and the Vice President had no formal power to act. Nonetheless, Nixon acted in Eisenhower's stead during this period, presiding over Cabinet meetings and ensuring that aides and Cabinet officers did not seek power.[87] According to Nixon biographer Stephen Ambrose, Nixon had \\\"earned the high praise he received for his conduct during the crisis\\u00a0... he made no attempt to seize power\\\".[88]\",\n",
      "  \"His spirits buoyed, Nixon sought a second term, but some of Eisenhower's aides aimed to displace him. In a December 1955 meeting, Eisenhower proposed that Nixon not run for reelection in order to give him administrative experience before a 1960 presidential run and instead become a Cabinet officer in a second Eisenhower administration. Nixon believed such an action would destroy his political career. When Eisenhower announced his reelection bid in February 1956, he hedged on the choice of his running mate, stating that it was improper to address that question until he had been renominated. Although no Republican was opposing Eisenhower, Nixon received a substantial number of write-in votes against the President in the 1956 New Hampshire primary election. In late April, the President announced that Nixon would again be his running mate.[89] Eisenhower and Nixon were reelected by a comfortable margin in the November 1956 election.[90]\",\n",

The bill was weakened in the Senate, and civil rights leaders were divided over whether Eisenhower should sign it. Nixon advised the President to sign the bill, which he did.[91] Eisenhower suffered a mild stroke in November 1957, and Nixon gave a press conference, assuring the nation that the Cabinet was functioning well as a team during Eisenhower's brief illness.[92]\",\n",
      "  \"On April 27, 1958, Richard and Pat Nixon reluctantly embarked on a goodwill tour of South America. In Montevideo, Uruguay, Nixon made an impromptu visit to a college campus, where he fielded questions from students on U.S. foreign policy. The trip was uneventful until the Nixon party reached Lima, Peru, where he was met with student demonstrations. Nixon went to the campus, got out of his car to confront the students, and stayed until forced back into the car by a volley of thrown objects. At his hotel, Nixon faced another mob, and one demonstrator spat on him.[93] In Caracas, Venezuela, Nixon and his wife were spat on by anti-American demonstrators and their limousine was attacked by a pipe-wielding mob.[94] According to Ambrose, Nixon's courageous conduct \\\"caused even some of his bitterest enemies to give him some grudging respect\\\".[95] Reporting to the cabinet after the trip, Nixon claimed that there was \\\"absolute proof that [the protestors] were directed and controlled by a central Communist conspiracy.\\\" Secretary of State John Foster Dulles concurred in this view; Director of Central Intelligence Allen Dulles sharply rebuked it.[96]\",\n",

He faced little opposition in the Republican primaries[98] and chose former Massachusetts Senator Henry Cabot Lodge Jr. as his running mate.[99] His Democratic opponent was John F. Kennedy, and the race remained close for the duration.[100] Nixon campaigned on his experience, but Kennedy called for new blood and claimed the Eisenhower\\u2013Nixon administration had allowed the Soviet Union to overtake the U.S. in ballistic missiles (the \\\"missile gap\\\").[101] A new political medium was introduced in the campaign: televised presidential debates. In the first of four such debates, Nixon appeared pale, with a five o'clock shadow, in contrast to the photogenic Kennedy.[99] Nixon's performance in the debate was perceived to be mediocre in the visual medium of television, though many people listening on the radio thought that Nixon had won.[102] Nixon lost the election narrowly, with Kennedy ahead by only 112,827 votes (0.2\\u00a0percent) in the popular vote.[99]\",\n",
      "  \"There were charges of vote fraud in Texas and Illinois, both states won by Kennedy; Nixon refused to consider contesting the election, feeling a lengthy controversy would diminish the United States in the eyes of the world, and the uncertainty would hurt U.S. interests.[103] At the end of his term of office as vice president in January 1961, Nixon and his family returned to California, where he practiced law and wrote a bestselling book, Six Crises, which included coverage of the Hiss case, Eisenhower's heart attack, and the Fund Crisis, which had been resolved by the Checkers speech.[99][104]\",\n",
      "  \"Local and national Republican leaders encouraged Nixon to challenge incumbent Pat Brown for Governor of California in the 1962 election.[99] Despite initial reluctance, Nixon entered the race.[99] The campaign was clouded by public suspicion that Nixon viewed the office as a stepping-stone for another presidential run, some opposition from the far-right of the party, and his own lack of interest in being California's governor.[99] Nixon hoped that a successful run would confirm his status as the nation's leading active Republican politician, and ensure he remained a major player in national politics.[105] Instead, he lost to Brown by more than five percentage points, and the defeat was widely believed to be the end of his political career.[99] In an impromptu concession speech the morning after the election, Nixon blamed the media for favoring his opponent, saying, \\\"You won't have Nixon to kick around anymore because, gentlemen, this is my last press conference\\\".[106] The California defeat was highlighted in the November 11, 1962, episode of ABC's Howard K. Smith: News and Comment, titled \\\"The Political Obituary of Richard M. Nixon\\\".[107] Alger Hiss appeared on the program, and many members of the public complained that it was unseemly to give a convicted felon air time to attack a former vice president. The furor drove Smith and his program from the air,[108] and public sympathy for Nixon grew.[107]\",\n",

On the Republican side, Nixon's main opposition was Michigan Governor George Romney, though New York Governor Nelson Rockefeller and California Governor Ronald Reagan each hoped to be nominated in a brokered convention. Nixon secured the nomination on the first ballot.[115] He selected Maryland Governor Spiro Agnew as his running mate, a choice which Nixon believed would unite the party, appealing to both Northern moderates and Southerners disaffected with the Democrats.[116]\",\n",

Agnew became an increasingly vocal critic of these groups, solidifying Nixon's position with the right.[118]\",\n",

He was persuaded by Kissinger that the papers were more harmful than they appeared, and the President tried to prevent publication. The Supreme Court eventually ruled for the newspapers.[152] Nixon's actions in favor of William Calley, sentenced to life imprisonment because of his role in the My Lai Massacre, which eventually led to his release, were approved by the 1971 public opinion but nowadays a point of criticism of his presidency.\",\n",

These activities concerned the Soviets and Cubans, who feared Nixon might attack Cuba and break the understanding between Kennedy and Khrushchev which had ended the missile crisis. In August 1970, the Soviets asked Nixon to reaffirm the understanding; despite his hard line against Castro, Nixon agreed. The process had not yet been completed when the Soviets began expanding their base at the Cuban port of Cienfuegos in October 1970.

Nixon and Brezhnev proclaimed a new era of \\\"peaceful coexistence\\\". A banquet was held that evening at the Kremlin.[159]\",\n",
      "  \"Seeking to foster better relations with the United States, both China and the Soviet Union cut back on their diplomatic support for North Vietnam and advised Hanoi to come to terms militarily.[160][161][162] Nixon later described his strategy:\",\n",
      "  \"I had long believed that an indispensable element of any successful peace initiative in Vietnam was to enlist, if possible, the help of the Soviets and the Chinese. Though rapprochement with China and d\\u00e9tente with the Soviet Union were ends in themselves, I also considered them possible means to hasten the end of the war. At worst, Hanoi was bound to feel less confident if Washington was dealing with Moscow and Beijing. At best, if the two major Communist powers decided that they had bigger fish to fry, Hanoi would be pressured into negotiating a settlement we could accept.[163]\",\n",
      "  \"Having made considerable progress over the previous two years in U.S.-Soviet relations, Nixon embarked on a second trip to the Soviet Union in 1974.[164] He arrived in Moscow on June 27 to a welcome ceremony, cheering crowds, and a state dinner at the Grand Kremlin Palace that evening.[164] Nixon and Brezhnev met in Yalta, where they discussed a proposed mutual defense pact, d\\u00e9tente, and MIRVs. While he considered proposing a comprehensive test-ban treaty, Nixon felt he would not have time as president to complete it.[164] There were no significant breakthroughs in these negotiations.[164]\",\n",
      "  \"As part of the Nixon Doctrine that the U.S. would avoid direct combat assistance to allies where possible, instead giving them assistance to defend themselves, the U.S. greatly increased arms sales to the Middle East\\u2014particularly Israel, Iran and Saudi Arabia\\u2014during the Nixon administration.[165] The Nixon administration strongly supported Israel, an American ally in the Middle East, but the support was not unconditional. Nixon believed that Israel should make peace with its Arab neighbors and that the United States should encourage it. The president believed that\\u2014except during the Suez Crisis\\u2014the U.S. had failed to intervene with Israel, and should use the leverage of the large U.S. military aid to Israel to urge the parties to the negotiating table. The Arab-Israeli conflict was not a major focus of Nixon's attention during his first term\\u2014for one thing, he felt that no matter what he did, American Jews would oppose his reelection.[a]\",\n",
      "  \"On October 6, 1973, an Arab coalition led by Egypt and Syria, supported with arms and materiel by the Soviet Union, attacked Israel in the Yom Kippur War. Israel suffered heavy losses and Nixon ordered an airlift to resupply Israeli losses, cutting through inter-departmental squabbles and bureaucracy and taking personal responsibility for any response by Arab nations. More than a week later, by the time the U.S. and Soviet Union began negotiating a truce, Israel had penetrated deep into enemy territory. The truce negotiations rapidly escalated into a superpower crisis; when Israel gained the upper hand, Egyptian President Sadat requested a joint U.S.-USSR peacekeeping mission, which the U.S. refused. When Soviet Premier Brezhnev threatened to unilaterally enforce any peacekeeping mission militarily, Nixon ordered the U.S. military to DEFCON3,[166] placing all U.S. military personnel and bases on alert for nuclear war. This was the closest that the world had come to nuclear war since the Cuban Missile Crisis. Brezhnev backed down as a result of Nixon's actions.[167]\",\n",
      "  \"Because Israel's victory was largely due to U.S. support, the Arab OPEC nations retaliated by refusing to sell crude oil to the U.S., resulting in the 1973 oil crisis.[168] The embargo caused gasoline shortages and rationing in the United States in late 1973, and was eventually ended by the oil-producing nations as peace in the Middle East took hold.[169]\",\n",
      "  \"After the war, and under Nixon's presidency, the U.S. reestablished relations with Egypt for the first time since 1967. Nixon used the Middle East crisis to restart the stalled Middle East Peace Negotiations; he wrote in a confidential memo to Kissinger on October 20:\",\n",
      "  \"I believe that, beyond a doubt, we are now facing the best opportunity we have had in 15 years to build a lasting peace in the Middle East. I am convinced history will hold us responsible if we let this opportunity slip by\\u00a0... I now consider a permanent Middle East settlement to be the most important final goal to which we must devote ourselves.[170]\",\n",

      "  \"At the time Nixon took office in 1969, inflation was at 4.7\\u00a0percent\\u2014its highest rate since the Korean War. The Great Society had been enacted under Johnson, which, together with the Vietnam War costs, was causing large budget deficits. Unemployment was low, but interest rates were at their highest in a century.[172] Nixon's major economic goal was to reduce inflation; the most obvious means of doing so was to end the war.[172] This could not be accomplished overnight, and the U.S. economy continued to struggle through 1970, contributing to a lackluster Republican performance in the midterm congressional elections (Democrats controlled both Houses of Congress throughout Nixon's presidency).[173] According to political economist Nigel Bowles in his 2011 study of Nixon's economic record, the new president did little to alter Johnson's policies through the first year of his presidency.[174]\",\n",
      "  \"Nixon was far more interested in foreign affairs than domestic policies, but believed that voters tend to focus on their own financial condition, and that economic conditions were a threat to his reelection. As part of his \\\"New Federalism\\\" views, he proposed grants to the states, but these proposals were for the most part lost in the congressional budget process. However, Nixon gained political credit for advocating them.[173] In 1970, Congress had granted the President the power to impose wage and price freezes, though the Democratic majorities, knowing Nixon had opposed such controls through his career, did not expect Nixon to actually use the authority.[174] With inflation unresolved by August 1971, and an election year looming, Nixon convened a summit of his economic advisers at Camp David. He then announced temporary wage and price controls, allowed the dollar to float against other currencies, and ended the convertibility of the dollar into gold.[175] Bowles points out,\",\n",
      "  \"by identifying himself with a policy whose purpose was inflation's defeat, Nixon made it difficult for Democratic opponents\\u00a0... to criticize him. His opponents could offer no alternative policy that was either plausible or believable since the one they favored was one they had designed but which the president had appropriated for himself.[174]\",\n",
      "  \"Nixon's policies dampened inflation through 1972, although their aftereffects contributed to inflation during his second term and into the Ford administration.[175]\",\n",
      "  \"After Nixon won re-election, inflation was returning.[176] He reimposed price controls in June 1973. The price controls became unpopular with the public and businesspeople, who saw powerful labor unions as preferable to the price board bureaucracy.[176] The controls produced food shortages, as meat disappeared from grocery stores and farmers drowned chickens rather than sell them at a loss.[176] Despite the failure to control inflation, controls were slowly ended, and on April 30, 1974, their statutory authorization lapsed.[176]\",\n",
      "  \"Nixon advocated a \\\"New Federalism\\\", which would devolve power to state and local elected officials, though Congress was hostile to these ideas and enacted few of them.[177] He eliminated the Cabinet-level United States Post Office Department, which in 1971 became the government-run United States Postal Service.[178]\",\n",
      "  \"Nixon was a late supporter of the conservation movement. Environmental policy had not been a significant issue in the 1968 election; the candidates were rarely asked for their views on the subject. He saw that the first Earth Day in April 1970 presaged a wave of voter interest on the subject, and sought to use that to his benefit; in June he announced the formation of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).[179] He relied on his domestic advisor John Ehrlichman, who favored protection of natural resources, to keep him \\\"out of trouble on environmental issues.\\\"[180] Nixon broke new ground by discussing environment policy in his State of the Union speech; other initiatives supported by Nixon included the Clean Air Act of 1970 and Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA); the National Environmental Policy Act required environmental impact statements for many Federal projects.[180][179] Nixon vetoed the Clean Water Act of 1972\\u2014objecting not to the policy goals of the legislation but to the amount of money to be spent on them, which he deemed excessive. After Congress overrode his veto, Nixon impounded the funds he deemed unjustifiable.[181]\",\n",
      "  \"In 1971, Nixon proposed health insurance reform\\u2014a private health insurance employer mandate,[b] federalization of Medicaid for poor families with dependent minor children,[182] and support for health maintenance organizations (HMOs).[183] A limited HMO bill was enacted in 1973.[183] In 1974, Nixon proposed more comprehensive health insurance reform\\u2014a private health insurance employer mandate[b] and replacement of Medicaid by state-run health insurance plans available to all, with income-based premiums and cost sharing.[184]\",\n",
      "  \"Concerned about the prevalence of drug use both domestically and among American soldiers in Vietnam, Nixon called for a War on Drugs, pledging to cut off sources of supply abroad, and to increase funds for education and for rehabilitation facilities.[185]\",\n",
      "  \"As one policy initiative, Nixon called for more money for sickle-cell research, treatment, and education in February 1971[186] and signed the National Sickle Cell Anemia Control Act on May 16, 1972.[187][188][c] While Nixon called for increased spending on such high-profile items as sickle-cell disease and for a War on Cancer, at the same time he sought to reduce overall spending at the National Institutes of Health.[189]\",\n",
      "  \"The Nixon presidency witnessed the first large-scale integration of public schools in the South.[190] Nixon sought a middle way between the segregationist Wallace and liberal Democrats, whose support of integration was alienating some Southern whites.[191] Hopeful of doing well in the South in 1972, he sought to dispose of desegregation as a political issue before then. Soon after his inauguration, he appointed Vice President Agnew to lead a task force, which worked with local leaders\\u2014both white and black\\u2014to determine how to integrate local schools. Agnew had little interest in the work, and most of it was done by Labor Secretary George Shultz. Federal aid was available, and a meeting with President Nixon was a possible reward for compliant committees. By September 1970, less than ten percent of black children were attending segregated schools. By 1971, however, tensions over desegregation surfaced in Northern cities, with angry protests over the busing of children to schools outside their neighborhood to achieve racial balance. Nixon opposed busing personally but enforced court orders requiring its use.[192]\",\n",
      "  \"In addition to desegregating public schools, Nixon implemented the Philadelphia Plan in 1970\\u2014the first significant federal affirmative action program.[193] He also endorsed the Equal Rights Amendment after it passed both houses of Congress in 1972 and went to the states for ratification.[194] Nixon had campaigned as an ERA supporter in 1968, though feminists criticized him for doing little to help the ERA or their cause after his election. Nevertheless, he appointed more women to administration positions than Lyndon Johnson had.[195]\",\n",
      "  \"After a nearly decade-long national effort, the United States won the race to land astronauts on the Moon on July 20, 1969, with the flight of Apollo 11.

      "  \"Nixon was unwilling to keep funding for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) at the high level seen during the 1960s as NASA prepared to send men to the Moon. NASA Administrator Thomas O. Paine drew up ambitious plans for the establishment of a permanent base on the Moon by the end of the 1970s and the launch of a manned expedition to Mars as early as 1981. Nixon rejected both proposals due to the expense.[197] Nixon also canceled the Air Force Manned Orbital Laboratory program in 1969, because unmanned spy satellites were a more cost-effective way to achieve the same reconnaissance objective.[198]\",\n",
      "  \"On March 7, 1970, Nixon announced the end of the Kennedy-Johnson era's massive efforts in the space race, stating \\\"We must think of [space activities] as part of a continuing process [...] and not as a series of separate leaps, each requiring a massive concentration of energy. [...] We must also realize that space expenditures must take their proper place within a rigorous system of national priorities. What we do in space from here on in must become a normal and regular part of our national life and must therefore be planned in conjunction with all of the other undertakings which are also important to us.\\\"[199] He then cancelled the last three planned Apollo lunar missions to place Skylab in orbit more efficiently and free money up for the design and construction of the Space Shuttle.[200]\",\n",

      "  \"Nixon believed his rise to power had peaked at a moment of political realignment. The Democratic \\\"Solid South\\\" had long been a source of frustration to Republican ambitions. Goldwater had won several Southern states by opposing the Civil Rights Act of 1964 but had alienated more moderate Southerners. Nixon's efforts to gain Southern support in 1968 were diluted by Wallace's candidacy. Through his first term, he pursued a Southern Strategy with policies, such as his desegregation plans, that would be broadly acceptable among Southern whites, encouraging them to realign with the Republicans in the aftermath of the civil rights movement. He nominated two Southern conservatives, Clement Haynsworth and G. Harrold Carswell to the Supreme Court, but neither was confirmed by the Senate.[202]\",\n",

      "  \"On June 10, McGovern won the California primary and secured the Democratic nomination.[206] The following month, Nixon was renominated at the 1972 Republican National Convention. He dismissed the Democratic platform as cowardly and divisive.[207] McGovern intended to sharply reduce defense spending[208] and supported amnesty for draft evaders as well as abortion rights. With some of his supporters believed to be in favor of drug legalization, McGovern was perceived as standing for \\\"amnesty, abortion and acid\\\". McGovern was also damaged by his vacillating support for his original running mate, Missouri Senator Thomas Eagleton, dumped from the ticket following revelations that he had received treatment for depression.[209][210] Nixon was ahead in most polls for the entire election cycle, and was reelected on November 7, 1972 in one of the largest landslide election victories in American history. He defeated McGovern with over 60\\u00a0percent of the popular vote, losing only in Massachusetts and the District of Columbia.[211]\",\n",
      "  \"The term Watergate has come to encompass an array of clandestine and often illegal activities undertaken by members of the Nixon administration. Those activities included \\\"dirty tricks,\\\" such as bugging the offices of political opponents, and the harassment of activist groups and political figures. The activities were brought to light after five men were caught breaking into Democratic party headquarters at the Watergate complex in Washington, D.C. on June 17, 1972. The Washington Post picked up on the story; reporters Carl Bernstein and Bob Woodward relied on an informant known as \\\"Deep Throat\\\"\\u2014later revealed to be Mark Felt, associate director at the FBI\\u2014to link the men to the Nixon administration. Nixon downplayed the scandal as mere politics, calling news articles biased and misleading. A series of revelations made it clear that the Committee to Re-elect President Nixon, and later the White House, was involved in attempts to sabotage the Democrats. Senior aides such as White House Counsel John Dean faced prosecution; in total 48 officials were convicted of wrongdoing.[117][212][213]\",\n",
      "  \"In July 1973, White House aide Alexander Butterfield testified under oath to Congress that Nixon had a secret taping system that recorded his conversations and phone calls in the Oval Office. These tapes were subpoenaed by Watergate Special Counsel Archibald Cox; Nixon provided transcripts of the conversations but not the actual tapes, citing executive privilege. With the White House and Cox at loggerheads, Nixon had Cox fired in October in the \\\"Saturday Night Massacre\\\"; he was replaced by Leon Jaworski. In November, Nixon's lawyers revealed that a tape of conversations held in the White House on June 20, 1972 had an 18\\u00bd-minute gap.[213] Rose Mary Woods, the President's personal secretary, claimed responsibility for the gap, saying that she had accidentally wiped the section while transcribing the tape, but her story was widely mocked. The gap, while not conclusive proof of wrongdoing by the President, cast doubt on Nixon's statement that he had been unaware of the cover-up.[214]\",\n",
      "  \"Though Nixon lost much popular support, even from his own party, he rejected accusations of wrongdoing and vowed to stay in office.[213] He insisted that he had made mistakes but had no prior knowledge of the burglary, did not break any laws, and did not learn of the cover-up until early 1973.[215] On October 10, 1973, Vice President Agnew resigned for reasons unrelated to Watergate: he was convicted on charges of bribery, tax evasion and money laundering during his tenure as governor of Maryland. Believing his first choice, John Connally, would not be confirmed by Congress,[216] Nixon chose Gerald Ford, Minority Leader of the House of Representatives, to replace Agnew.[217] One researcher suggests Nixon effectively disengaged from his own administration after Ford was sworn in as Vice President on December 6, 1973.[218]\",\n",
      "  \"On November 17, 1973, during a televised question-and-answer session with the press,[219] Nixon said, \\\"People have got to know whether or not their President is a crook. Well, I'm not a crook. I've earned everything I've got.\\\"[220]\",\n",
      "  \"The legal battle over the tapes continued through early 1974, and in April 1974 Nixon announced the release of 1,200 pages of transcripts of White House conversations between him and his aides. The House Judiciary Committee opened impeachment hearings against the President on May 9, 1974, which were televised on the major TV networks. These hearings culminated in votes for impeachment.[215] On July 24, the Supreme Court ruled unanimously that the full tapes, not just selected transcripts, must be released.[221]\",\n",
      "  \"The scandal grew to involve a slew of additional allegations against the President, ranging from the improper use of government agencies to accepting gifts in office and his personal finances and taxes; Nixon repeatedly stated his willingness to pay any outstanding taxes due, and paid $465,000 in back taxes in 1974.[222]\",\n",
      "  \"Even with support diminished by the continuing series of revelations, Nixon hoped to fight the charges. But one of the new tapes, recorded soon after the break-in, demonstrated that Nixon had been told of the White House connection to the Watergate burglaries soon after they took place, and had approved plans to thwart the investigation. In a statement accompanying the release of what became known as the \\\"Smoking Gun Tape\\\" on August 5, 1974, Nixon accepted blame for misleading the country about when he had been told of White House involvement, stating that he had had a lapse of memory.[223] Senate Minority Leader Hugh Scott, Senator Barry Goldwater, and House Minority Leader John Jacob Rhodes met with Nixon soon after. Rhodes told Nixon that he faced certain impeachment in the House.

Nixon stated that he was resigning for the good of the country and asked the nation to support the new president, Gerald Ford.

Ford insisted on a statement of contrition, but Nixon felt he had not committed any crimes and should not have to issue such a document. Ford eventually agreed, and on September 8, 1974, he granted Nixon a \\\"full, free, and absolute pardon\\\", which ended any possibility of an indictment. Nixon then released a statement:\",\n",

He maintained an office in a Coast Guard station 300 yards from his home, at first taking a golf cart and later walking the route each day; he mainly worked on his memoirs.[239] He had hoped to wait before writing his memoirs; the fact that his assets were being eaten away by expenses and lawyer fees compelled him to begin work quickly.[240] He was handicapped in this work by the end of his transition allowance in February, which compelled him to part with many of his staff, including Ziegler.[241] In August of that year, he met with British talk-show host and producer David Frost, who paid him $600,000 (equivalent to $2,730,000 in 2017) for a series of sit-down interviews, filmed and aired in 1977.[242] They began on the topic of foreign policy, recounting the leaders he had known, but the most remembered section of the interviews was that on Watergate.

He joined former Presidents Ford and Carter as representatives of the United States at the funeral of Egyptian President Anwar Sadat.[230] On a trip to the Middle East, Nixon made his views known regarding Saudi Arabia and Libya, which attracted significant U.S. media attention; The Washington Post ran stories on Nixon's \\\"rehabilitation\\\".[257] Nixon visited the Soviet Union in 1986 and on his return sent President Reagan a lengthy memorandum containing foreign policy suggestions and his personal impressions of Mikhail Gorbachev.[230] Following this trip, Nixon was ranked in a Gallup poll as one of the ten most admired men in the world.[258]\",\n",

      "  \"Historian and political scientist James MacGregor Burns asked of Nixon, \\\"How can one evaluate such an idiosyncratic president, so brilliant and so morally lacking?\\\"[277] Nixon's biographers disagree on how he will be perceived by posterity. According to Ambrose, \\\"Nixon wanted to be judged by what he accomplished. What he will be remembered for is the nightmare he put the country through in his second term and for his resignation.\\\"[278] Irwin Gellman, who chronicled Nixon's Congressional career, suggests that \\\"he was remarkable among his congressional peers, a success story in a troubled era, one who steered a sensible anti-Communist course against the excess of McCarthy\\\".[279] Aitken feels that \\\"Nixon, both as a man and as a statesman, has been excessively maligned for his faults and inadequately recognised for his virtues. Yet even in a spirit of historical revisionism, no simple verdict is possible.\\\"[280]\",\n",
      "  \"Some historians say Nixon's Southern Strategy made the South a Republican stronghold, while others deem economic factors more important in the change.[202] Throughout his career, Nixon moved his party away from the control of isolationists, and as a Congressman he was a persuasive advocate of containing Soviet communism.[281] According to his biographer Herbert Parmet, \\\"Nixon's role was to steer the Republican party along a middle course, somewhere between the competitive impulses of the Rockefellers, the Goldwaters, and the Reagans.\\\"[282]\",\n",
      "  \"Nixon's stance on domestic affairs has been credited with the passage and enforcement of environmental and regulatory legislation. In a 2011 paper on Nixon and the environment, historian Paul Charles Milazzo points to Nixon's creation of the EPA and his enforcement of legislation such as the 1973 Endangered Species Act, stating that \\\"though unsought and unacknowledged, Richard Nixon's environmental legacy is secure\\\".[283] Nixon himself did not consider the environmental advances he made in office an important part of his legacy; some historians contend that his choices were driven more by political expediency than any strong environmentalism.[180]\",\n",
      "  \"Nixon saw his policies on Vietnam, China, and the Soviets as central to his place in history.[165] Nixon's onetime opponent George McGovern commented in 1983, \\\"President Nixon probably had a more practical approach to the two superpowers, China and the Soviet Union, than any other president since World War II [...] With the exception of his inexcusable continuation of the war in Vietnam, Nixon really will get high marks in history.\\\"[284] Political scientist Jussi Hanhim\\u00e4ki disagrees, saying Nixon's diplomacy was merely a continuation of the Cold War policy of containment by diplomatic rather than military means.[165] Historian Christopher Andrew concludes that \\\"Nixon was a great statesman on the world stage as well as a shabby practitioner of electoral politics in the domestic arena. While the criminal farce of Watergate was in the making, Nixon's inspirational statesmanship was establishing new working relationships with both Communist China and the Soviet Union.\\\"[285]\",\n",
      "  \"Historian Keith W. Olson has written that Nixon left a legacy of fundamental mistrust of government, rooted in Vietnam and Watergate.[286] During the impeachment of Bill Clinton in 1998, both sides tried to use Nixon and Watergate to their advantage: Republicans suggested that Clinton's misconduct was comparable to Nixon's, while Democrats contended that Nixon's actions had been far more serious than Clinton's.[287] Another legacy, for a time, was a decrease in the power of the presidency as Congress passed restrictive legislation in the wake of Watergate. Olson suggests that legislation in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks restored the president's power.[286]\"\n",

      " \"Personality and public image\": [\n",
      "  \"Nixon's career was frequently dogged by his persona and the public's perception of it. Editorial cartoonists and comedians often exaggerated his appearance and mannerisms, to the point where the line between the human and the caricature became increasingly blurred. He was often portrayed with unshaven jowls, slumped shoulders, and a furrowed, sweaty brow.[288]\",\n",
      "  \"Nixon had a complex personality, both very secretive and awkward, yet strikingly reflective about himself. He was inclined to distance himself from people and was formal in all aspects, wearing a coat and tie even when home alone.[289] Nixon biographer Conrad Black described him as being \\\"driven\\\" though also \\\"uneasy with himself in some ways\\\".[290] According to Black, Nixon\",\n",
      "  \"thought that he was doomed to be traduced, double-crossed, unjustly harassed, misunderstood, underappreciated, and subjected to the trials of Job, but that by the application of his mighty will, tenacity, and diligence, he would ultimately prevail.[291]\",\n",
      "  \"Biographer Elizabeth Drew summarized Nixon as a \\\"smart, talented man, but most peculiar and haunted of presidents\\\".[292] In his account of the Nixon presidency, author Richard Reeves described Nixon as \\\"a strange man of uncomfortable shyness, who functioned best alone with his thoughts\\\".[293] Nixon's presidency was doomed by his personality, Reeves argues:\",\n",
      "  \"He assumed the worst in people and he brought out the worst in them\\u00a0... He clung to the idea of being 'tough'. He thought that was what had brought him to the edge of greatness. But that was what betrayed him. He could not open himself to other men and he could not open himself to greatness.[294]\",\n",
      "  \"Nixon believed that putting distance between himself and other people was necessary for him as he advanced in his political career and became president. Even Bebe Rebozo, by some accounts his closest friend, did not call him by his first name. Nixon stated of this,\",\n",
      "  \"Even with close friends, I don't believe in letting your hair down, confiding this and that and the other thing\\u2014saying, 'Gee, I couldn't sleep'\\u00a0... I believe you should keep your troubles to yourself. That's just the way I am. Some people are different. Some people think it's good therapy to sit with a close friend and, you know, just spill your guts\\u00a0... [and] reveal their inner psyche\\u2014whether they were breast-fed or bottle-fed. Not me. No way.[295]\",\n",
      "  \"When told that most Americans, even at the end of his career, did not feel they knew him, Nixon replied, \\\"Yeah, it's true. And it's not necessary for them to know.\\\"[295]\"\n",

It is played by 250 million players in over 200 countries and dependencies, making it the world's most popular sport.[5][6][7][8] The game is played on a rectangular field called a pitch with a goal at each end. The object of the game is to score by moving the ball beyond the goal line into the opposing goal. \\n\",\n",
      "  \"Association football is one of a family of football codes, which emerged from various ball games played worldwide since antiquity. The modern game traces its origins to 1863 when the Laws of the Game were originally codified in England by The Football Association.\\n\",\n",
      "  \"Players are not allowed to touch the ball with hands or arms while it is in play, except for the goalkeepers within the penalty area. Other players mainly use their feet to strike or pass the ball, but may also use any other part of their body except the hands and the arms. The team that scores most goals by the end of the match wins. If the score is level at the end of the game, either a draw is declared or the game goes into extra time or a penalty shootout depending on the format of the competition. Association football is governed internationally by the International Federation of Association Football (FIFA; French: F\\u00e9d\\u00e9ration Internationale de Football Association), which organises World Cups for both men and women every four years.[9]\\n\",\n",

      "  \"The rules of association football were codified in England by the Football Association in 1863 and the name association football was coined to distinguish the game from the other forms of football played at the time, specifically rugby football. The first written \\\"reference to the inflated ball used in the game\\\" was in the mid-14th century: \\\"\\u00dee heued fro \\u00fee body went, Als it were a foteballe\\\".[10] The Online Etymology Dictionary states that the word \\\"soccer\\\" was \\\"split off in 1863\\\".[11] According to Partha Mazumdar, the term soccer originated in England, first appearing in the 1880s as an Oxford \\\"-er\\\" abbreviation of the word \\\"association\\\".[12]\\n\",\n",

      " \"History\": [\n",
      "  \"According to FIFA, the Chinese competitive game cuju (\\u8e74\\u97a0, literally \\\"kick ball\\\") is the earliest form of football for which there is evidence.[4] Cuju players could use any part of the body apart from hands and the intent was kicking a ball through an opening into a net. It was remarkably similar to modern football, though similarities to rugby occurred.[15][16] During the Han Dynasty (206 BC \\u2013 220 AD), cuju games were standardised and rules were established.[15]\\n\",\n",
      "  \"Phaininda and episkyros were Greek ball games.[17][18] An image of an episkyros player depicted in low relief on a vase at the National Archaeological Museum of Athens[14] appears on the UEFA European Championship Cup.[19] Athenaeus, writing in 228 AD, referenced the Roman ball game harpastum. Phaininda, episkyros and harpastum were played involving hands and violence. They all appear to have resembled rugby football, wrestling and volleyball more than what is recognizable as modern football.[15][20][21][22][23][24] As with pre-codified \\\"mob football\\\", the antecedent of all modern football codes, these three games involved more handling the ball than kicking.[25][26] Other games included kemari in Japan,[27] chuk-guk in Korea and woggabaliri in Australia.[28][29]\\n\",\n",
      "  \"Association football in itself does not have a classical history.[19] Notwithstanding any similarities to other ball games played around the world FIFA has recognised that no historical connection exists with any game played in antiquity outside Europe.[30] The modern rules of association football are based on the mid-19th century efforts to standardise the widely varying forms of football played in the public schools of England. The history of football in England dates back to at least the eighth century AD.[31]\\n\",\n",
      "  \"The Cambridge Rules, first drawn up at Cambridge University in 1848, were particularly influential in the development of subsequent codes, including association football. The Cambridge Rules were written at Trinity College, Cambridge, at a meeting attended by representatives from Eton, Harrow, Rugby, Winchester and Shrewsbury schools. They were not universally adopted. During the 1850s, many clubs unconnected to schools or universities were formed throughout the English-speaking world, to play various forms of football. Some came up with their own distinct codes of rules, most notably the Sheffield Football Club, formed by former public school pupils in 1857,[32] which led to formation of a Sheffield FA in 1867. In 1862, John Charles Thring of Uppingham School also devised an influential set of rules.[33]\\n\",\n",
      "  \"These ongoing efforts contributed to the formation of The Football Association (The FA) in 1863, which first met on the morning of 26 October 1863 at the Freemasons' Tavern in Great Queen Street, London.[34] The only school to be represented on this occasion was Charterhouse. The Freemason's Tavern was the setting for five more meetings between October and December, which eventually produced the first comprehensive set of rules. At the final meeting, the first FA treasurer, the representative from Blackheath, withdrew his club from the FA over the removal of two draft rules at the previous meeting: the first allowed for running with the ball in hand; the second for obstructing such a run by hacking (kicking an opponent in the shins), tripping and holding. Other English rugby clubs followed this lead and did not join the FA and instead in 1871 formed the Rugby Football Union. The eleven remaining clubs, under the charge of Ebenezer Cobb Morley, went on to ratify the original thirteen laws of the game.[34] These rules included handling of the ball by \\\"marks\\\" and the lack of a crossbar, rules which made it remarkably similar to Victorian rules football being developed at that time in Australia. The Sheffield FA played by its own rules until the 1870s with the FA absorbing some of its rules until there was little difference between the games.[35]\\n\",\n",
      "  \"The world's oldest football competition is the FA Cup, which was founded by C. W. Alcock and has been contested by English teams since 1872. The first official international football match also took place in 1872, between Scotland and England in Glasgow, again at the instigation of C. W. Alcock. England is also home to the world's first football league, which was founded in Birmingham in 1888 by Aston Villa director William McGregor.[36] The original format contained 12 clubs from the Midlands and Northern England.\\n\",\n",
      "  \"The laws of the game are determined by the International Football Association Board (IFAB).[37] The board was formed in 1886[38] after a meeting in Manchester of The Football Association, the Scottish Football Association, the Football Association of Wales, and the Irish Football Association. FIFA, the international football body, was formed in Paris in 1904 and declared that they would adhere to Laws of the Game of the Football Association.[39] The growing popularity of the international game led to the admittance of FIFA representatives to the International Football Association Board in 1913. The board consists of four representatives from FIFA and one representative from each of the four British associations.[40]\\n\",\n",
      "  \"Today, football is played at a professional level all over the world. Millions of people regularly go to football stadiums to follow their favourite teams,[41] while billions more watch the game on television or on the internet.[42][43] A very large number of people also play football at an amateur level. According to a survey conducted by FIFA published in 2001, over 240 million people from more than 200 countries regularly play football.[44] Football has the highest global television audience in sport.[45]\\n\",\n",
      "  \"In many parts of the world football evokes great passions and plays an important role in the life of individual fans, local communities, and even nations. R. Kapuscinski says that Europeans who are polite, modest, or humble fall easily into rage when playing or watching football games.[46] The C\\u00f4te d'Ivoire national football team helped secure a truce to the nation's civil war in 2006[47] and it helped further reduce tensions between government and rebel forces in 2007 by playing a match in the rebel capital of Bouak\\u00e9, an occasion that brought both armies together peacefully for the first time.[48] By contrast, football is widely considered to have been the final proximate cause for the Football War in June 1969 between El Salvador and Honduras.[49] The sport also exacerbated tensions at the beginning of the Yugoslav Wars of the 1990s, when a match between Dinamo Zagreb and Red Star Belgrade degenerated into rioting in May 1990.[50]\\n\",\n",
      "  \"Women may have been playing \\\"football\\\" for as long as the game has existed. Evidence shows that an ancient version of the game (Tsu Chu) was played by women during the Han Dynasty (25\\u2013220 CE). Two female figures are depicted in Han Dynasty (25\\u2013220 CE) frescoes, playing Tsu Chu.[51] There are, however, a number of opinions about the accuracy of dates, the earliest estimates at 5000 BCE.[52]\\n\",\n",
      "  \"Association football, the modern game, also has documented early involvement of women. An annual competition in Mid-Lothian, Scotland during the 1790s is reported, too.[53][54] In 1863, football governing bodies introduced standardised rules to prohibit violence on the pitch, making it more socially acceptable for women to play.[55] The first match recorded by the Scottish Football Association took place in 1892 in Glasgow. In England, the first recorded game of football between women took place in 1895.[55][56]\\n\",\n",
      "  \"The most well-documented early European team was founded by activist Nettie Honeyball in England in 1894. It was named the British Ladies' Football Club. Nettie Honeyball is quoted, \\\"I founded the association late last year [1894], with the fixed resolve of proving to the world that women are not the 'ornamental and useless' creatures men have pictured. I must confess, my convictions on all matters where the sexes are so widely divided are all on the side of emancipation, and I look forward to the time when ladies may sit in Parliament and have a voice in the direction of affairs, especially those which concern them most.\\\" [57] Honeyball and those like her paved the way for women's football. However, the women's game was frowned upon by the British football associations, and continued without their support. It has been suggested that this was motivated by a perceived threat to the 'masculinity' of the game.[58]\\n\",\n",
      "  \"Women's football became popular on a large scale at the time of the First World War, when employment in heavy industry spurred the growth of the game, much as it had done for men fifty years earlier. The most successful team of the era was Dick, Kerr's Ladies of Preston, England. The team played in the first women's international matches in 1920, against a team from Paris, France, in April, and also made up most of the England team against a Scottish Ladies XI in 1920, and winning 22-0.[53]\\n\",\n",
      "  \"Despite being more popular than some men's football events (one match saw a 53,000 strong crowd),[59] women's football in England suffered a blow in 1921 when The Football Association outlawed the playing of the game on Association members' pitches, on the grounds that the game (as played by women) was distasteful.[60] Some speculated that this may have also been due to envy of the large crowds that women's matches attracted.[61] This led to the formation of the English Ladies Football Association and play moved to rugby grounds.[62]\\n\",\n",
      "  \"Association football has been played by women since at least the time of the first recorded women's games in the late 19th century.[63][64] It has traditionally been associated with charity games and physical exercise, particularly in the United Kingdom.[64] In the late 1960s and early 1970s women's association football was organised in the United Kingdom, eventually becoming the most prominent team sport for British women.[64]\\n\",\n",
      "  \"The growth in women's football has seen major competitions being launched at both national and international level mirroring the male competitions. Women's football has faced many struggles. It had a \\\"golden age\\\" in the United Kingdom in the early 1920s when crowds reached 50,000 at some matches;[65] this was stopped on 5 December 1921 when England's Football Association voted to ban the game from grounds used by its member clubs. The FA's ban was rescinded in December 1969 with UEFA voting to officially recognise women's football in 1971.[64] The FIFA Women's World Cup was inaugurated in 1991 and has been held every four years since,[66] while women's football has been an Olympic event since 1996.\\n\"\n",

      "  \"Association football is played in accordance with a set of rules known as the Laws of the Game. The game is played using a spherical ball of 68\\u201370\\u00a0cm (27\\u201328\\u00a0in) circumference,[67] known as the football (or soccer ball). Two teams of eleven players each compete to get the ball into the other team's goal (between the posts and under the bar), thereby scoring a goal. The team that has scored more goals at the end of the game is the winner; if both teams have scored an equal number of goals then the game is a draw. Each team is led by a captain who has only one official responsibility as mandated by the Laws of the Game: to represent his or her team in the coin toss prior to kick-off or penalty kicks.[68]\\n\",\n",
      "  \"The primary law is that players other than goalkeepers may not deliberately handle the ball with their hands or arms during play, though they must use both their hands during a throw-in restart. Although players usually use their feet to move the ball around they may use any part of their body (notably, \\\"heading\\\" with the forehead)[69] other than their hands or arms.[70] Within normal play, all players are free to play the ball in any direction and move throughout the pitch, though the ball cannot be received in an offside position.[71]\\n\",\n",
      "  \"During gameplay, players attempt to create goal-scoring opportunities through individual control of the ball, such as by dribbling, passing the ball to a teammate, and by taking shots at the goal, which is guarded by the opposing goalkeeper. Opposing players may try to regain control of the ball by intercepting a pass or through tackling the opponent in possession of the ball; however, physical contact between opponents is restricted. Football is generally a free-flowing game, with play stopping only when the ball has left the field of play or when play is stopped by the referee for an infringement of the rules. After a stoppage, play recommences with a specified restart.[72]\\n\",\n",
      "  \"At a professional level, most matches produce only a few goals. For example, the 2005\\u201306 season of the English Premier League produced an average of 2.48 goals per match.[73] The Laws of the Game do not specify any player positions other than goalkeeper,[74] but a number of specialised roles have evolved. Broadly, these include three main categories: strikers, or forwards, whose main task is to score goals; defenders, who specialise in preventing their opponents from scoring; and midfielders, who dispossess the opposition and keep possession of the ball to pass it to the forwards on their team. Players in these positions are referred to as outfield players, to distinguish them from the goalkeeper. These positions are further subdivided according to the area of the field in which the player spends most time. For example, there are central defenders, and left and right midfielders. The ten outfield players may be arranged in any combination. The number of players in each position determines the style of the team's play; more forwards and fewer defenders creates a more aggressive and offensive-minded game, while the reverse creates a slower, more defensive style of play. While players typically spend most of the game in a specific position, there are few restrictions on player movement, and players can switch positions at any time.[75] The layout of a team's players is known as a formation. Defining the team's formation and tactics is usually the prerogative of the team's manager.[76]\\n\"\n",

      " \"Laws\": [\n",
      "  \"There are 17 laws in the official Laws of the Game, each containing a collection of stipulation and guidelines. The same laws are designed to apply to all levels of football, although certain modifications for groups such as juniors, seniors, women and people with physical disabilities are permitted. The laws are often framed in broad terms, which allow flexibility in their application depending on the nature of the game. The Laws of the Game are published by FIFA, but are maintained by the International Football Association Board (IFAB).[77] In addition to the seventeen laws, numerous IFAB decisions and other directives contribute to the regulation of football.\\n\",\n",
      "  \"Each team consists of a maximum of eleven players (excluding substitutes), one of whom must be the goalkeeper. Competition rules may state a minimum number of players required to constitute a team, which is usually seven. Goalkeepers are the only players allowed to play the ball with their hands or arms, provided they do so within the penalty area in front of their own goal. Though there are a variety of positions in which the outfield (non-goalkeeper) players are strategically placed by a coach, these positions are not defined or required by the Laws.[74]\\n\",\n",
      "  \"The basic equipment or kit players are required to wear includes a shirt, shorts, socks, footwear and adequate shin guards. An athletic supporter and protective cup is highly recommended for male players by medical experts and professionals.[78][79] Headgear is not a required piece of basic equipment, but players today may choose to wear it to protect themselves from head injury.[80] Players are forbidden to wear or use anything that is dangerous to themselves or another player, such as jewellery or watches. The goalkeeper must wear clothing that is easily distinguishable from that worn by the other players and the match officials.[81]\\n\",\n",
      "  \"A number of players may be replaced by substitutes during the course of the game. The maximum number of substitutions permitted in most competitive international and domestic league games is three in ninety minutes with each team being allowed one more if the game should go into extra-time, though the permitted number may vary in other competitions or in friendly matches. Common reasons for a substitution include injury, tiredness, ineffectiveness, a tactical switch, or timewasting at the end of a finely poised game. In standard adult matches, a player who has been substituted may not take further part in a match.[82] IFAB recommends \\\"that a match should not continue if there are fewer than seven players in either team.\\\" Any decision regarding points awarded for abandoned games is left to the individual football associations.[83]\\n\",\n",
      "  \"\\nA game is officiated by a referee, who has \\\"full authority to enforce the Laws of the Game in connection with the match to which he has been appointed\\\" (Law 5), and whose decisions are final. The referee is assisted by two assistant referees. In many high-level games there is also a fourth official who assists the referee and may replace another official should the need arise.[84]\\n\",\n",
      "  \"Goal line technology is used to measure if the whole ball has crossed the goal-line thereby determining if a goal has or hasn't been scored, this was brought in to prevent there being controversy. Video assistant referee (VAR) has also been increasingly introduced to assist officials through video replay to correct clear and obvious mistakes. There are four types of calls that can be reviewed: mistaken identity in awarding a red or yellow card, goals and whether there was a violation during the buildup, direct red card decisions, and penalty decisions.[85]\\n\",\n",
      "  \"The ball is spherical with a circumference of between 68 and 70 centimetres (27 and 28\\u00a0in), a weight in the range of 410 to 450 grams (14 to 16\\u00a0oz), and a pressure between 0.6 and 1.1 bars (8.5 and 15.6 pounds per square inch)  at sea level. In the past the ball was made up of leather panels sewn together, with a latex bladder for pressurisation but modern balls at all levels of the game are now synthetic.[86][87]\\n\",\n",
      "  \"As the Laws were formulated in England, and were initially administered solely by the four British football associations within IFAB, the standard dimensions of a football pitch were originally expressed in imperial units. The Laws now express dimensions with approximate metric equivalents (followed by traditional units in brackets), though use of imperial units remains popular in English-speaking countries with a relatively recent history of metrication (or only partial metrication), such as Britain.[88]\\n\",\n",
      "  \"The length of the pitch, or field, for international adult matches is in the range of 100\\u2013110\\u00a0m (110\\u2013120\\u00a0yd) and the width is in the range of 64\\u201375\\u00a0m (70\\u201380\\u00a0yd). Fields for non-international matches may be 90\\u2013120\\u00a0m (100\\u2013130\\u00a0yd) length and 45\\u201390\\u00a0m (50\\u2013100\\u00a0yd) in width, provided that the pitch does not become square. In 2008, the IFAB initially approved a fixed size of 105\\u00a0m (344\\u00a0ft) long and 68\\u00a0m (223\\u00a0ft) wide as a standard pitch dimension for international matches;[89] however, this decision was later put on hold and was never actually implemented.[90]\\n\",\n",
      "  \"The longer boundary lines are touchlines, while the shorter boundaries (on which the goals are placed) are goal lines. A rectangular goal is positioned at the middle of each goal line.[91] The inner edges of the vertical goal posts must be 24 feet (7.3\\u00a0m) apart, and the lower edge of the horizontal crossbar supported by the goal posts must be 8 feet (2.4\\u00a0m) above the ground. Nets are usually placed behind the goal, but are not required by the Laws.[92]\\n\",\n",
      "  \"In front of the goal is the penalty area. This area is marked by the goal line, two lines starting on the goal line 16.5\\u00a0m (18\\u00a0yd) from the goalposts and extending 16.5\\u00a0m (18\\u00a0yd) into the pitch perpendicular to the goal line, and a line joining them. This area has a number of functions, the most prominent being to mark where the goalkeeper may handle the ball and where a penalty foul by a member of the defending team becomes punishable by a penalty kick. Other markings define the position of the ball or players at kick-offs, goal kicks, penalty kicks and corner kicks.[93]\\n\",\n",
      "  \"A standard adult football match consists of two halves of 45 minutes each. Each half runs continuously, meaning that the clock is not stopped when the ball is out of play. There is usually a 15-minute half-time break between halves. The end of the match is known as full-time.[94] The referee is the official timekeeper for the match, and may make an allowance for time lost through substitutions, injured players requiring attention, or other stoppages. This added time is called additional time in FIFA documents,[95][96] but is most commonly referred to as stoppage time or injury time, while loss time can also be used as a synonym. The duration of stoppage time is at the sole discretion of the referee. Stoppage time does not fully compensate for the time in which the ball is out of play, and a 90-minute game typically involves about an hour of \\\"effective playing time\\\".[97] The referee alone signals the end of the match. In matches where a fourth official is appointed, towards the end of the half the referee signals how many minutes of stoppage time he intends to add. The fourth official then informs the players and spectators by holding up a board showing this number. The signalled stoppage time may be further extended by the referee.[94] Added time was introduced because of an incident which happened in 1891 during a match between Stoke and Aston Villa. Trailing 1\\u20130 and with just two minutes remaining, Stoke were awarded a penalty. Villa's goalkeeper kicked the ball out of the ground, and by the time the ball had been recovered, the 90\\u00a0minutes had elapsed and the game was over.[98] The same law also states that the duration of either half is extended until the penalty kick to be taken or retaken is completed, thus no game shall end with a penalty to be taken.[99]\\n\",\n",
      "  \"In league competitions, games may end in a draw. In knockout competitions where a winner is required various methods may be employed to break such a deadlock; some competitions may invoke replays.[100] A game tied at the end of regulation time may go into extra time, which consists of two further 15-minute periods. If the score is still tied after extra time, some competitions allow the use of penalty shootouts (known officially in the Laws of the Game as \\\"kicks from the penalty mark\\\") to determine which team will progress to the next stage of the tournament. Goals scored during extra time periods count towards the final score of the game, but kicks from the penalty mark are only used to decide the team that progresses to the next part of the tournament (with goals scored in a penalty shootout not making up part of the final score).[68]\\n\",\n",
      "  \"In competitions using two-legged matches, each team competes at home once, with an aggregate score from the two matches deciding which team progresses. Where aggregates are equal, the away goals rule may be used to determine the winners, in which case the winner is the team that scored the most goals in the leg they played away from home. If the result is still equal, extra time and potentially a penalty shootout are required.[68]\\n\",\n",
      "  \"In the late 1990s and early 2000s, the IFAB experimented with ways of creating a winner without requiring a penalty shootout, which was often seen as an undesirable way to end a match. These involved rules ending a game in extra time early, either when the first goal in extra time was scored (golden goal), or if one team held a lead at the end of the first period of extra time (silver goal). Golden goal was used at the World Cup in 1998 and 2002. The first World Cup game decided by a golden goal was France's victory over Paraguay in 1998. Germany was the first nation to score a golden goal in a major competition, beating Czech Republic in the final of Euro 1996. Silver goal was used in Euro 2004. Both these experiments have been discontinued by IFAB.[101]\\n\",\n",
      "  \"Under the Laws, the two basic states of play during a game are ball in play and ball out of play. From the beginning of each playing period with a kick-off until the end of the playing period, the ball is in play at all times, except when either the ball leaves the field of play, or play is stopped by the referee. When the ball becomes out of play, play is restarted by one of eight restart methods depending on how it went out of play:\\n\",\n",
      "  \"A foul occurs when a player commits an offence listed in the Laws of the Game while the ball is in play. The offences that constitute a foul are listed in Law 12. Handling the ball deliberately, tripping an opponent, or pushing an opponent, are examples of \\\"penal fouls\\\", punishable by a direct free kick or penalty kick depending on where the offence occurred. Other fouls are punishable by an indirect free kick.[70]\\n\",\n",
      "  \"The referee may punish a player's or substitute's misconduct by a caution (yellow card) or dismissal (red card). A second yellow card in the same game leads to a red card, which results in a dismissal. A player given a yellow card is said to have been \\\"booked\\\", the referee writing the player's name in his official notebook. If a player has been dismissed, no substitute can be brought on in their place and the player may not participate in further play. Misconduct may occur at any time, and while the offences that constitute misconduct are listed, the definitions are broad. In particular, the offence of \\\"unsporting behaviour\\\" may be used to deal with most events that violate the spirit of the game, even if they are not listed as specific offences. A referee can show a yellow or red card to a player, substitute or substituted player. Non-players such as managers and support staff cannot be shown the yellow or red card, but may be expelled from the technical area if they fail to conduct themselves in a responsible manner.[70]\\n\",\n",
      "  \"Rather than stopping play, the referee may allow play to continue if doing so will benefit the team against which an offence has been committed. This is known as \\\"playing an advantage\\\".[107] The referee may \\\"call back\\\" play and penalise the original offence if the anticipated advantage does not ensue within \\\"a few seconds\\\". Even if an offence is not penalised due to advantage being played, the offender may still be sanctioned for misconduct at the next stoppage of play.[108]\\n\",\n",
      "  \"The referee's decision in all on-pitch matters is considered final.[109] The score of a match cannot be altered after the game, even if later evidence shows that decisions (including awards/non-awards of goals) were incorrect.\\n\",\n",
      "  \"Along with the general administration of the sport, football associations and competition organisers also enforce good conduct in wider aspects of the game, dealing with issues such as comments to the press, clubs' financial management, doping, age fraud and match fixing. Most competitions enforce mandatory suspensions for players who are sent off in a game.[110] Some on-field incidents, if considered very serious (such as allegations of racial abuse), may result in competitions deciding to impose heavier sanctions than those normally associated with a red card.[b] Some associations allow for appeals against player suspensions incurred on-field if clubs feel a referee was incorrect or unduly harsh.[110]\\n\",\n",
      "  \"Sanctions for such infractions may be levied on individuals or on to clubs as a whole. Penalties may include fines, points deductions (in league competitions) or even expulsion from competitions. For example, the English Football League  deduct 12 points from any team that enters financial administration.[111] Among other administrative sanctions are penalties against game forfeiture. Teams that had forfeited a game or had been forfeited against would be awarded a technical loss or win.\\n\"\n",

      "  \"National associations oversee football within individual countries. These are generally synonymous with sovereign states, (for example: the F\\u00e9d\\u00e9ration Camerounaise de Football in Cameroon) but also include a smaller number of associations responsible for sub-national entities or autonomous regions (for example the Scottish Football Association in Scotland). 209 national associations are affiliated both with FIFA and with their respective continental confederations.[112]\\n\",\n",
      "  \"While FIFA is responsible for arranging competitions and most rules related to international competition, the actual Laws of the Game are set by the International Football Association Board, where each of the UK Associations has one vote, while FIFA collectively has four votes.[40]\\n\"\n",
      " ],\n",
      " \"International competitions\": [\n",
      "  \"The major international competition in football is the World Cup, organised by FIFA. This competition takes place every four years since 1930 with the exception of 1942 and 1946 tournaments, which were cancelled due to World War II. Approximately 190\\u2013200 national teams compete in qualifying tournaments within the scope of continental confederations for a place in the finals. The finals tournament, which is held every four years, involves 32 national teams competing over a four-week period.[c] The World Cup is the most prestigious association football tournament in the world as well as the most widely viewed and followed sporting event in the world, exceeding even the Olympic Games; the cumulative audience of all matches of the 2006 FIFA World Cup was estimated to be 26.29 billion with an estimated 715.1 million people watching the final match, a ninth of the entire population of the planet.[113][114][115][116] The current champion is France, which won its second title at the 2018 tournament in Russia. FIFA Women's World Cup has been held every four years since 1991. Under the tournament's current format, national teams vie for 23 slots in a three-year qualification phase. (The host nation's team is automatically entered as the 24th slot.) The current champion is the United States, after winning their third title in the 2015 FIFA Women's World Cup.\\n\",\n",
      "  \"There has been a football tournament at every Summer Olympic Games since 1900, except at the 1932 games in Los Angeles.[117] Before the inception of the World Cup, the Olympics (especially during the 1920s) were the most prestigious international event. Originally, the tournament was for amateurs only.[39] As professionalism spread around the world, the gap in quality between the World Cup and the Olympics widened. The countries that benefited most were the Soviet Bloc countries of Eastern Europe, where top athletes were state-sponsored while retaining their status as amateurs. Between 1948 and 1980, 23 out of 27 Olympic medals were won by Eastern Europe, with only Sweden (gold in 1948 and bronze in 1952), Denmark (bronze in 1948 and silver in 1960) and Japan (bronze in 1968) breaking their dominance. For the 1984 Los Angeles Games, the IOC decided to admit professional players. FIFA still did not want the Olympics to rival the World Cup, so a compromise was struck that allowed teams from Africa, Asia, Oceania and CONCACAF to field their strongest professional sides, while restricting UEFA and CONMEBOL teams to players who had not played in a World Cup. Since 1992 male competitors must be under 23 years old, and since 1996, players under 23 years old, with three over-23 year old players, are allowed per squad. A women's tournament was added in 1996; in contrast to the men's event, full international sides without age restrictions play the women's Olympic tournament.[118]\\n\",\n",
      "  \"After the World Cup, the most important international football competitions are the continental championships, which are organised by each continental confederation and contested between national teams. These are the European Championship (UEFA), the Copa Am\\u00e9rica (CONMEBOL), African Cup of Nations (CAF), the Asian Cup (AFC), the CONCACAF Gold Cup (CONCACAF) and the OFC Nations Cup (OFC). The FIFA Confederations Cup is contested by the winners of all six continental championships, the current FIFA World Cup champions and the country which is hosting the Confederations Cup. This is generally regarded as a warm-up tournament for the upcoming FIFA World Cup and does not carry the same prestige as the World Cup itself. The most prestigious competitions in club football are the respective continental championships, which are generally contested between national champions, for example the UEFA Champions League in Europe and the Copa Libertadores in South America. The winners of each continental competition contest the FIFA Club World Cup.[119]\\n\"\n",

      " \"Domestic competitions\": [\n",
      "  \"The governing bodies in each country operate league systems in a domestic season, normally comprising several divisions, in which the teams gain points throughout the season depending on results. Teams are placed into tables, placing them in order according to points accrued. Most commonly, each team plays every other team in its league at home and away in each season, in a round-robin tournament. At the end of a season, the top team is declared the champion. The top few teams may be promoted to a higher division, and one or more of the teams finishing at the bottom are relegated to a lower division.[121]\\n\",\n",
      "  \"The teams finishing at the top of a country's league may be eligible also to play in international club competitions in the following season. The main exceptions to this system occur in some Latin American leagues, which divide football championships into two sections named Apertura and Clausura (Spanish for Opening and Closing), awarding a champion for each.[122] The majority of countries supplement the league system with one or more \\\"cup\\\" competitions organised on a knock-out basis.\\n\",\n",
