The municipality of Amsterdam has 864,217 inhabitants (as of January 31, 2019) and agglomeration Groot-Amsterdam 1,362,270 inhabitants (as of February 28, 2018). In the metropolitan area of \\u200b\\u200bAmsterdam, which makes up the northern part of the Dutch conurbation Randstad, live about 2.4 million people (2012). Although the seat of government of the country and the royal residence located in 60 kilometers from The Hague, Amsterdam has been the Netherlands' capital since 1983, according to the Dutch constitution. [5]\", 'Amsterdam is located in the Dutch province of North Holland, where Amstel and IJ flow directly into the IJsselmeer. The port of the city is connected by the North Sea Canal with the North Sea. Amsterdam is world famous for the many canals.'], 'Municipal districts with residential districts and districts [edit | Edit]': ['Since 1 May 2010, there is a new classification of the municipalities of Amsterdam (formerly 14, now seven districts). These are in turn divided into the districts of Amsterdam.', 'Amsterdam Center', 'In Amsterdam-West:', 'In Amsterdam New West:', 'In Amsterdam South:', 'In Amsterdam East', 'In Amsterdam North', 'In Amsterdam Southeast'], 'Geography [edit | Edit]': ['The Amsterdamm level was set 1683/1684 as a zero point for height measurements. The water level of the middle flood (MHW) was chosen. This water level was about 17 cm above the mean water. The water level of the Amsterdam canals today is about 40 cm below the sea level of the North Sea.', 'The Dutch weather usually varies from a light frost in the winter with some snow to sunny days of 20 to 30 ° C in the summer. Spring and fall are mild, but can be very wet and rainy (over 100 mm of precipitation per month).', 'Amsterdam as well as the entire European Netherlands are in the Central European Time Zone. Since the city is located far west in this time zone, the sun is only at 12:40 clock (during the summer time at 13:40 clock) exactly in the south. This leads in the summer along with the northern location of the city to a late sunset; in midsummer, it may still be bright until 11pm.'], 'History [edit | Edit]': ['The name of the city derives from a 13th century dam with a lock in the Amstel river; There was a fishing village, which bore the name Amstelredam. The Latin name was Amstelodamum, later Amstelaedam (Amstelædam). The drainage of the estuary was necessary to protect the previously developed development on both river banks from storm surges, because the former Zuiderzee was an open bay to the North Sea, and the land was lowered due to drainage measures. The dam, which was placed in the Amstel, connected the settlement nuclei previously formed on both sides, which today are called Oude Zijde and Nieuwe Zijde (old and new side).', 'In the course of the Middle Ages, an urban square was built on the site of the Amstel Dam, which today still bears the name Dam and represents the center of the city.', \"Until the 13th century, today's province of Holland was for the most part poorly populated. It was a very humid area, consisting mainly of bog and marshland and intersected by several rivers. One of these rivers was the Amstel, which flowed into the IJ called inlets. By storm surges of the IJ had broadened the mouth of the Amstel to a narrow, elongated bay. Around this time around 500 fishermen had settled in huts until 1230.\", 'Lords of the Amstellandes around the river of the same name was the noble family van Amstel, who sat as ministerial staff of the Hochstift Utrecht at the castle in Ouderkerk aan de Amstel, until it was destroyed in 1204 by rebellious farmers from the Kennemerland. They then built themselves a new castle, the Kasteel van Amstel, whose suspected foundations were found during excavations in 1994-1999 under the present street Nieuwezijds Kolk. Around 1270 they had the river, at the point where he widened to the bay, separated by the eponymous Dam. From this time there is a contract between Gijsbrecht IV van A (e) mstel, who inherited the property in 1265, and his brother Willem, Provost in Mijdrecht, on the drainage of his land in the Amstel. The settlement is first mentioned in 1275 as \"Amstelledamme\". From this dam, the dike ran on both sides of the bay in curves to the north, where the current streets Nieuwendijk and Warmoesstraat (and further southeast of the Zeedijk) are still higher than their surroundings. Such dikes also originated elsewhere along the Zuiderzee. After archaeological excavations proves the old children\\'s song Amsterdam, the beautiful city, built on piles as quite right: In fact, could only with the help of countless piles underground - rammed up to 18 m deep through the boggy soil in the solid sand - houses and streets to be built in marshland. The first church built in the second half of the 13th century, the Oude Kerk instead of a wooden chapel. From 1408 followed the larger Nieuwe Kerk.', 'Florens V., Count of Holland, tried to seize the new commercial port and granted its traders duty free. Gijsbrecht van Amstel, who had rebelled against the bishop of Utrecht, had in 1285 submit to the count as a vassal, but was involved in 1296 in his murder. His son, Jan van Amstel, used a Flemish invasion of Holland in 1303 to break away from it, but was subjugated after the Flemings had left and had to drag down the city walls and destroy the bridges; the place lost all trading privileges. These were renewed only after the final incorporation of Amsterdam into the county of Holland in 1317. Then Amsterdam was granted city rights, as they had previously received Dordrecht, Haarlem, Delft and Leiden. Among the Counts of Avesnes and their successors, the Wittelsbachers of the line Bayern-Straubing, Holland experienced a period of prosperity, which was ended with the invasion of the Burgundian power - in 1433 Holland fell to Philip the Good, who ruled it from Brussels. The Hook and Cod War between 1350 and 1490 was a long smoldering middle-class power struggle in the Dutch cities, in league with the Burgundian dukes, against the interests of the local feudal nobility.', \"The fishing, initially the most important source of income, gradually gave way to trade, especially with dried or salted herring from the Swedish south coast and with beer from Hamburg, for which Amsterdam was granted an import monopoly in 1323. In 1347 locks are mentioned for the first time, which made the tedious transport of the goods over the dam unnecessary, in that the ships could drive through laid masts. Later, locks at the inlet of the Amstel also entered the city and at its mouth into the IJ and channels traversed and enclosed the city, as depicted by Cornelis Anthonisz. from 1538 can be seen. At that time, the city had about 30,000 inhabitants and consisted of the core of today's old town. Amsterdam was never a member of the Hanseatic League [7], with which it came to trade conflicts and dispute over the passage through the Oresund, which was settled in 1441 by comparison. New techniques (immediate guttering of the fish on board) also made fishing in the North Sea more efficient. Salt and tropical fruits were imported from the Mediterranean. Amsterdam became a staple and transshipment market and the goods were further processed, creating production techniques, sciences, banking and insurance and printing.\", 'In the city government of Amsterdam were originally all male citizens who had the city rights, they were called \"Poorter\". In the Middle Ages, the Schouts (Schultheißen) and the councilors (Schepen) by the Count of Holland or its representatives, the Baljuw (Vogt) van Amstelland, set. In the late Middle Ages, however, the patricians managed to exclude the artisans from the city government and in fact to establish an oligarchy. As in other Dutch cities, Vroedschap, with 36 members, appointed the magistrate, which consisted of four mayors and a number of shepherds since the end of the 14th century. The four simultaneously acting mayors, the regents of Amsterdam, each remained in office for one year. When the longest servant left, the three others chose a successor from the magistrate. This ensured that the powerful regency was reserved for a few families. This system of government did not end until 1795 with the French Revolutionary Laws in the Batavian Republic.', 'In 1477, the Burgundian heritage - Holland with neighboring countries - fell to the Habsburgs. In gratitude for a loan of 10,000 pounds of silver in 1489, Maximilian I gave Amsterdam the right to place the imperial crown over the coat of arms - a sustained gain in prestige. Under his grandson Emperor Charles V, the County of Holland was incorporated into the Seventeen Provinces. However, the most important ports remained there initially Antwerp and Rotterdam, especially for goods from the new colonies in South America.', 'Since 1492 Jews came from Spain to Amsterdam, since the mid-16th century also Ashkenazi Jews from Poland. They became part of the city. There were numerous synagogues and several Jewish printers. An Anabaptist rebellion was cruelly suppressed in 1535. The Reformation led from about 1550 to the spread of Calvinism.', \"In 1566, the iconoclasm unleashed the conflict with Emperor Charles 'son and heir, Philip II of Spain, and became an external occasion for the beginning of the Eighty Years' War with Spain. In 1567, Philip II sent an army to the Netherlands to quell the rebellion and was led by the Duke of Alba, who set up a terror regiment and ruthlessly persecuted the Protestants with the help of the Inquisition.\", \"In contrast, in 1568 the Geuzen began an uprising, headed by Philip's former governor Wilhelm I of Orange-Nassau. Most cities in the north joined the insurgents, only Amsterdam and Middelburg supported the Spaniards, who besieged Haarlem from here in the winter of 1572/73 and finally conquered. In 1576, all Dutch provinces united in the Ghent pacification against Spain. On February 8, 1578, Amsterdam concluded a peace treaty with the Prince of Orange and the remaining Dutch provinces. A few months later, the City Council overthrew the Alteratie of Amsterdam, and the supporters of Spain and the higher Catholic clergy were put on two barges and expelled to the IJ. The Oude and the Nieuwe Kerk were reformed.\", 'In 1579, the Union disintegrated into a northern, Protestant, called the Union of Utrecht, to which Amsterdam belonged, and a southern, mainly Catholic Union of Arras. In 1581, the Northern Seven Provinces declared their formal independence from Spain. Here, Calvinism dominated, but was not a state church, while the south remained Catholic as the Spanish Netherlands. Amsterdam was comparatively tolerant religiously, the Catholic monasteries in the city were tolerated as well as prayer houses of Mennonites and Lutherans. Thus Amsterdam is still predominantly Calvinistic, but at the same time the center of the rather small Dutch Lutheranism. In 1609, Congregational religious refugees from England under the direction of John Smyth and Thomas Helwys founded the first Baptist church in a bakery on the Amsterdam Bakkerstraat as the nucleus of one of the largest Protestant church communities today. The Calvinist reform sect of the Remonstranten came however politically under pressure.', 'The resistance of Amsterdam prevented William of Orange from becoming monarch and receiving the historic title of Count of Holland; instead, he became governor of the Republic of the United Netherlands, whose center of power was the Parliament, which until today has been called the States-General. This constellation led to a generation-long rivalry between oligarchic city regents and popular in the people of Orange governor dynasty. In 1584 a catholic fanatic murdered Wilhelm in Delft. His son Moritz followed him and the struggle for the southern and northeastern provinces continued to oscillate until 1607 the Spaniards were defeated in the Battle of Gibraltar, where they were forced to agree in 1609 in Antwerp to a truce twelve years held long. In 1621, the conflict with Spain broke out again as part of the Thirty Years War and was formally ended only in 1648 with the Peace of Westphalia, which brought international recognition of the Republic of the United Netherlands and at the same time their withdrawal from the Holy Roman Empire.', 'The annexation of Portugal by Spain in 1580 had forced the northern Netherlands to sail even ships to India. The first rides were made from Amsterdam and led to a great success. Inspired by this result, plans were soon forged throughout the country to send more ships to India. From these individual initiatives arose in 1602 the Vereenigde Oost -Indische Compagnie (VOC). Residents of Amsterdam subscribed to more than half of the total capital invested in the new company, of which two-fifths were small-scale investors (craftsmen) and 84 major investors. 1621 also established the Dutch West India Company, founded in 1626 the city Nieuw Amsterdam, which is called New York since 1667. The Amsterdamer Wechselbank enjoyed a worldwide reputation. These trading companies made the republic a global sea and commercial power, which led to the ceasefire with Spain in 1609, the Golden Age of the Netherlands. This small, low-income state association, which had no raw materials and whose agricultural production was insignificant, became the major economic power of the mid-17th century and Amsterdam the most important European trading place and the most prosperous city of the continent, which was built from 1648 to 1665 Stadhuis (now Paleis op de Dam) built a magnificent town hall. The population grew from about 1600 to 1662 from about 40,000 to 210,000 inhabitants, the city was extended by new canals and received numerous new churches and social services. The warehouses piled up spices, silk, and other treasures from India and the Pacific; Science and literature, architecture, sculpture and painting (Rembrandt and his school) reached high points.', 'The success, however, also led to a rivalry with the great powers England and France. Between 1652 and 1674, three Anglo-Dutch naval wars took place, and in the Second Nordic War, the Netherlands had to simultaneously defend its trade interests in the Baltic Sea. The politician Johan de Witt and Fleet Commander Michiel de Ruyter coined this time. In the Rampjaar, the disaster year 1672, the Netherlands came simultaneously into a war with France and England. The Dutch War ended in 1679 with benefits for the French crown. Through the turmoil of war, the port of Amsterdam became inaccessible to the merchant fleet of goods from India. In addition, there were falling prices, English competition overseas, the damage to ships and wooden piles of the dikes by the shipworm and subsequent flooding, as well as the rinderpest that brought the export of cheese and butter to a standstill.', 'This led to the decline of Amsterdam as a port of transshipment for world trade and led to a change in economic structures towards the end of the century; Amsterdam lost its position as a major port city but gained increasing influence on the European money market. Amsterdam managed to become the financial center of the world - as a banker for European princes who used lent money to wage their costly wars. However, the rich citizens of the city now put their money in neighboring countries. In 1688 the governor Wilhelm III. from Oranien to the English king. When he died in 1702, the governorship was suspended and a return to the anti-centralist tradition of the city rulers occurred. It was not until 1747 that William IV became governor of all provinces again. The Age of Enlightenment, originating in France, caused unrest, denunciation of grievances and criticism of the system of the unlimited rule of the ruler alienated from the people. 1795, the Batavian Republic was proclaimed as the satellite state of Napoleonic France.', 'When he was appointed King of Holland on June 23, 1806, Louis Bonaparte declared Amsterdam his capital. However, this did not prevent Amsterdam from gradually becoming a \"dead\" and impoverished city in the first decades of the 19th century. The city only experienced a new boom when the Noordzeekanaal was opened in 1876, which gave Amsterdam a connection to the North Sea and thus to the United Kingdom and the United States (USA). Once again, Amsterdam became the center of cultural and scientific life, although it was gradually outstripped economically, especially after the Second World War, by Rotterdam.', 'Numerous centuries-old monuments adorn the city center. Nearly 7,000 merchants and warehouses as well as nearly 1,300 bridges from the 16th to the 18th century bear witness to this Golden Age. The trading houses were built along the 165 canals that were used as transport routes to facilitate the rapid distribution of import goods in the city and to the trading offices. The Amsterdam canal belt was also included in the UNESCO World Heritage List in 2010. [8] The river bed of the Amstel itself, origin of the settlement, was filled in the 19th and 20th centuries, however, except for Damrak and Rokin and overbuilt.', 'Since 2011, immigrants represent the majority of the population in Amsterdam. Among the under-15s, their share is two-thirds. The largest minority group after the Dutch are Moroccans. [9]'], 'Politics [edit | Edit]': ['Amsterdam is a center of drug tourism in Europe. This is due to the liberal policies of the Netherlands. Noteworthy are the many foreign drug users. In 2005, there were around 750 coffee shops throughout the Netherlands. In 2009 there were 228 coffee shops in Amsterdam. [10]', \"Of many foreign dissidents, Amsterdam was chosen as the new home. One common reason for this was the city's former liberal policies, often in combination with repressive policies in their country of origin.\", 'Since 1998 the police are allowed to carry out checks on persons; this is done under the name Amsterdam Wapenvrij (\"Amsterdam weapon-free\"). The reason was the large number and frequent use of illegal weapons. Among other things, there are reinforced passport controls.\\nSince January 1, 2005, a compulsory identification or compulsory participation is required throughout the Netherlands, according to which persons over the age of 14 must carry an ID card. However, it is not just about possession of firearms, but also large quantities of drugs and people who have been wanted for a long time for various offenses by the police. In principle, any person in the designated areas at the time of the checks can be controlled. The police are authorized to inspect packaging and contents of goods, means of transport and clothing of persons.

His coat of arms received it in the 15th century. The Great Coat of Arms with the two golden lions as shield holder got by Maximilian of Austria in 1489 the imperial crown on the blazon. In the year 1947 the coat of arms vowise came to it: After the liberation 1945 of the fascism the queen of the city gave the motto \"heroic, constantly (also: determined), mercifully\" as appreciation of the attitude of the citizens during the occupation in the years 1940 to 1945.', 'Importance of the coat of arms: The exact meaning of the coat of arms is unknown. But there are several theories that historians consider plausible, but so far can not be further proven. The two prevailing theories are:', 'Another theory says that the three crosses should remind of the apostle Andrew.', \"As evidence that the city took the coat of arms in the 15th century. The Roman-German King and later Emperor Maximilian I gave the city in 1489 the right to add his crown to the coat of arms. This was thanks for the financial support that he, as heirs of the Burgundian Netherlands, had been granted by the city during his dispute with Dutch nobles. Legend has it that during a stay in the city, after a prayer in one of the churches, Maximilian had recovered from a serious illness and had the coat of arms decorated with his crown. Maximilian's crown was replaced after its coronation to the Roman-German emperor by the imperial crown. At the time of Emperor Rudolf II, who had a new crown made, which later became the Austrian imperial crown, they adjusted the shape of the crown. The lions as shield holders were added in the 16th century. [18]\", 'Queen Wilhelmina took the attitude of the citizenry during the occupation by the German Reich in World War II and especially the February strike after the removal of the first Jews from Amsterdam in February 1941 as an opportunity, the city with the saying \"Heroic, Vast Berger, Barmhartig\" (heroic, Steadfast, Merciful). This motto came in 1947 in the coat of arms.', 'The coat of arms is omnipresent in the city, as it graces not only the typical in Amsterdam bollards (Amsterdammertjes), but also manhole covers, public buildings and many logos.'], 'Architecture [edit | Edit]': ['Since in the history of Amsterdam, the canals represented one of the main transport routes for goods and people, it was customary to measure the taxes for a building according to its width on the canal. As a result, mainly houses in Amsterdam have very narrow front fronts along the canals, but in order to provide sufficient housing or storage space for goods, they are relatively long and tall. However, this design was not suitable for the installation of wide staircases; rather, the staircases were usually too narrow for bulky goods or furniture. Objects that were difficult to transport across the stairwell were instead conveyed through the windows into the house. To facilitate this process, the gables of many historic buildings have projecting beams on which pulleys can be attached. Furthermore, many facades are slightly inclined forward, which is architecturally so intentional and is called op vilucht built. The prehension is 0.2 to 2.5 cm per meter of altitude. The gables could not be built in width because of the narrowness, but they were built in rich execution in the height. Gable variations from four centuries characterize the old town. Stair gables, beak gables, bell gables and inguinal gables are particularly common. [20]', 'On the other hand, in Amsterdam, houses used to be built on wooden posts, and these have slowly decayed over the centuries. [21] Therefore, the historic districts of Amsterdam make a slightly \"skewed\" or \"distorted\" impression. [22] Amsterdam stands on around five million wooden posts, which are necessary because of the damp, sandy ground. Today concrete piles are used because of longer durability, simpler construction methods and greater depth. The central station stands on approximately 8,600 piles, [23] the royal palace on 13,659 piles. A large part of these wooden piles was brought from the Black Forest and the Franconian Forest with rafts. Thus all the piles of the main station come from the Franconian Forest. [25] The timber for houses and ships as well as the firewood was also transported by rafts from these forests.', 'In Amsterdam there are many buildings in the style of the Amsterdam School, a style of expressionist architecture, including:', 'In Amsterdam there are nine objects that are included in the existing since 2007 Top 100 of the Dutch monuments 1940-1958:'], 'Culture [edit | Edit]': ['Internationally known is the football club Ajax, record champions of the Netherlands and multiple European Cup winner.
